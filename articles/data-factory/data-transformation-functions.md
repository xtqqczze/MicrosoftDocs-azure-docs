# Data transformation expressions in mapping data flows

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

[!INCLUDE[data-flow-preamble](includes/data-flow-preamble.md)]

By using data transformation expressions in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics, you can transform expressions in many ways. They're a powerful tool that you can use to customize the behavior of your pipelines in almost every setting and property. You can use them anywhere you find a text field that shows the **Add dynamic content** or **Open expression builder** links within your pipeline.
