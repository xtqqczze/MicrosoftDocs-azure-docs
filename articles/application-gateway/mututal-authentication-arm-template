# Configure mutual authentication with Application Gateway through ARM

This article describes how to use an ARM template to configure mutual authentication on your Application Gateway. Mutual authentication means Application Gateway authenticates the client sending the request using the client certificate you upload onto the Application Gateway. 

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Before you begin

To configure mutual authentication with an Application Gateway, you need a client certificate to upload to the gateway. The client certificate will be used to validate the certificate the client will present to Application Gateway. For testing purposes, you can use a self-signed certificate. However, this is not advised for production workloads, because they're harder to manage and aren't completely secure. 

To learn more, especially about what kind of client certificates you can upload, see [Overview of mutual authentication with Application Gateway](./mutual-authentication-overview.md#certificates-supported-for-mutual-authentication).



## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources that you created with the application gateway, delete the resource group. This removes the application gateway and all the related resources.

To delete the resource group, call the `Remove-AzResourceGroup` cmdlet:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <your resource group name>
```
