# Web app migration and modernization

Web app migration and modernization is the process of moving existing applications from on-premises or legacy environments to the cloud. It also involves upgrading apps to use modern frameworks, architectures, and services, enabling improved scalability, performance, and security. This approach helps organizations optimize costs and deliver faster, more reliable experiences.

Explore articles that explain how to migrate and modernize ASP.NET and Java web applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure App Service.

## Migrate to Azure Kubernetes Service

Migrate your applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable, secure, and containerized deployment.

- **ASP.NET app containerization and migration to AKS**: Use Azure Migrate: App Containerization to package ASP.NET apps without code access and deploy them on Azure Kubernetes Service. [Learn more](tutorial-app-containerization-aspnet-kubernetes.md).


- **Java web app containerization and migration to Azure Kubernetes Service**: App Containerization to package Java apps running on Apache Tomcat without code access and deploy them on Azure Kubernetes Service. [Learn more](tutorial-app-containerization-java-kubernetes.md).

## Migrate to Azure App Service

Migrate your applications to Azure App Service for a fully managed platform that simplifies deployment and scales effortlessly.

-  Containerize Java apps and deploy them on App Service containers. [Learn more](tutorial-app-containerization-java-app-service.md).

- Upgrade ASP.NET apps to modern code on App Service. [Learn more](tutorial-modernize-asp-net-appservice-code.md).

## Migrate web apps using GitHub Copilot

Migrate web apps using GitHub Copilot to accelerate modernization with AI-powered code insights and automation.

- Assess and migrate .NET projects to Azure with GitHub Copilot, which evaluates readiness, creates a migration plan, and automates code changes. [Learn more](/dotnet/azure/migration/appmod/quickstart).

-  Assess and migrate Java projects to Azure using GitHub Copilot app modernization, with automated readiness checks and predefined migration tasks. [Learn more](/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-github-copilot-app-modernization-for-java-quickstart-assess-migrate).

## Deploy containerized applications using Azure DevOps

Deploying containerized applications with Azure DevOps automates building, testing, and deploying containerized apps to cloud or Kubernetes environments.

- Automate continuous deployment of containerized applications with Azure pipelines that build Docker images, push to Azure Container Registry, and deploy to AKS or App Service. [Learn more](/azure/migrate/tutorial-app-containerization-azure-pipeline).
