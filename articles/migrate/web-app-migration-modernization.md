# Web app migration and modernization

Web app migration and modernization is the process of moving existing applications from on-premises or legacy environments to the cloud. It also involves upgrading apps to use modern frameworks, architectures, and services, enabling improved scalability, performance, and security. This approach helps organizations optimize costs and deliver faster, more reliable experiences.

## Migrate to Azure Kuberenetes Service

**ASP.NET app containerization and migration to Azure Kubernetes Service**: Containerize ASP.NET applications and migrate them to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool. This tool simplifies containerization without requiring code access by packaging apps based on their running state. It supports deploying ASP.NET apps on Windows containers in AKS or App Service, and Java web apps on Linux containers in AKS or App Service. [Learn more](tutorial-app-containerization-aspnet-kubernetes.md).


**Java web app containerization and migration to Azure Kubernetes Service**: Containerize Java web applications running on Apache Tomcat and migrate them to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using the Azure Migrate: App Containerization tool. The process doesn’t require code access and packages apps based on their running state. The tool supports deploying Java apps on Linux containers in AKS or App Service, and ASP.NET apps on Windows containers in AKS or App Service.
