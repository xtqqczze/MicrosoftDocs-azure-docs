# Reliability in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

[Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) let you create and manage a group of virtual machines (VM) instances. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. They enable high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across multiple availability zones and fault domains.

[!INCLUDE [Shared responsibility description](includes/reliability-shared-responsibility-include.md)]

This article describes how to make Virtual Machine Scale Sets resilient to a variety of potential outages and problems, including transient faults, availability zone outages, VM reconfiguration, and service maintenance. It also describes how you can use backups to recover from other types of problems, and highlights some key information about the Virtual Machine Scale Sets service level agreement (SLA).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you consider the reliability of a scale set and its virtual machines (VMs), you also need to consider the reliability of your disks, network infrastructure, and applications that run on your VMs. Improving the resiliency of the VMs alone might have limited impact if the other components aren't equally resilient. Depending on your resiliency requirements, you might need to make configuration changes across multiple areas.

## Production deployment recommendations

The Azure Well-Architected Framework provides recommendations across reliability, performance, security, cost, and operations. To understand how these areas influence each other and contribute to a reliable Virtual Machine Scale Sets solution, see [Architecture best practices for Virtual Machines and scale sets in the Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/virtual-machines).

## Reliability architecture overview

<!-- This section focuses on fault domain spreading, but not zone spreading or any mention of AZs. Seems a little odd. -->


A scale set groups multiple VM instances together and applies centralized configuration, autoscale rules, and rolling upgrades.

Scale sets support two distinct [orchestration modes](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-orchestration-modes):

- *Uniform scale sets* deploy VMs with identical configuration and you manage them as a group. 
- *Flexible scale sets (Recommended)* give you more flexibility around deploying and managing individual VM instances.

### Fault domain spreading and load balancing 

*Fault domains* are fault isolation groups within a datacenter. Each fault domain is analogous to a server rack, which is a collection of hardware nodes that share the same power, networking, cooling, and platform maintenance schedule. Because the VM instances of each scale set are spread across multiple fault domains, a planned or unplanned outage that occurs in one fault domain isn't likely to impact the VM instances in other fault domains. 

When you deploy a scale set, you can control how many fault domains the VMs are spread across. 

For some situations, you should use the *max spreading* behavior, which uses as many fault domains as possible. For more information, see [Choosing the right number of fault domains for Virtual Machine Scale Set](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-manage-fault-domains).

Scale sets can be integrated with Azure load balancing services, including Azure Load Balancer and Azure Application Gateway. When the scale set adds or removes instances, the built-in load balancer integration automatically updates the load balancer configuration. For more information, see [Networking for Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking).

Scale sets include many other controls and capabilities that affect how instances are deployed, scaled, distributed, and updated. For more information, see [What are Virtual Machine Scale Sets?](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview).

## Resilience to transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Virtual machines transient faults](includes/virtual-machines/transient-faults-include.md)]

## Resilience to instance problems

When a scale set initiates a VM instance creation or deletion operation, it's possible that the operation to fail. To automatically retry failed VM instance creation or deletion operations, consider using [Resilient create and delete for Virtual Machine Scale Sets (Preview)](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/resilient-vm-create-delete).

While instances are running, it's possible for problems to occur. For example, an instance might become unresponsive due to application crashes or resource exhaustion. You can configure automatic repair actions, such as restarting, reimaging, or replacing a VM instance with [Automatic instance repairs](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-instance-repairs). With automatic instance repairs, the platform monitors your application's health and automatically performs the repair action when it's required.

## Resilience to availability zone failures

[!INCLUDE [Resilience to availability zone failures](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Virtual Machine Scale Sets supports availability zones in both zone-spanning and zonal configurations.

- *Zone-spanning:* A *zone-spanning* scale set spreads instances across multiple availability zones that you select.  

    Spreading instances across availability zones gives you the highest SLA for VM instances, and is recommended for most VM-based workloads in Azure.

    With zone-spanning, each VM instance - including its disks - is zonal, which means it is pinned to a specific availability zone. When all availability zones are healthy, instances can maintain inter-zonal connectivity through the high-performance, low-latency network.  If a zone outage or connectivity issue compromises the connectivity to instances in the affected zone, instances in the healthy zones should remain unaffected.

    By default, the scale set performs a best effort approach to evenly spread instances across selected zones. However, if you require strict balancing, you can choose to [change the zone balancing configuration](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-zone-balancing).

   
    The following diagram shows a zone-spanning scale set spread across three zones, with one instance in each zone:

    :::image type="content" source="media/reliability-virtual-machine-scale-sets/zone-spanning.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows a zone-spanning scale set with three instances, each deployed into a separate availability zone." border="false":::

    Zone-spanning is similar to [zone redundancy](./availability-zones-overview.md#types-of-availability-zone-support) in other Azure services, but with certain differences. For example, scale sets don't provide automatic replication of data across zones or failover when zones are down. There are also situations where a zone-spanning scale set might have all of its instances deployed in a single zone, such as if you choose to attach individual VMs to a zone-spanning Flexible scale set.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Flexible orchestration mode and attach, detach, or remove individual VMs, ensure that the VMs are spread across multiple zones. If the VMs are all in a single zone, your scale set might not be resilient to an outage in that zone.

- *Zonal:* A zonal scale set, also sometimes called *zone-aligned*, places all its instances in a single availability zone that you specify. Each VM and its disks are zonal, so they are pinned to that specific zone.

    [!INCLUDE [Zonal resource description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-zonal-include.md)]

    The following diagram shows a zonal scale set in a single zone, with three instances in that zone:

    :::image type="content" source="media/reliability-virtual-machine-scale-sets/zonal.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows a zonal scale set with three instances, each deployed into the same availability zone." border="false":::

If you don't specify availability zones to use for your scale set, it's *nonzonal* or *regional*, which means that the instances might be placed in any availability zone within the region or within the same zone. There's no guarantee that instances are balanced or spread across zones, or that instances are placed in the same availability zone. When you use a nonzonal scale set, disk colocation in the same zone is guaranteed for Ultra and Premium v2 disks, is provided on a best-effort basis for Premium V1 disks, and not guaranteed for Standard SKU (SSD or HDD) disks. If any availability zone in the region has a problem, your scale set might experience downtime.

<!-- John: So here, I am assuming there is no support for fault domains. I am unclear of the connection/relationship between fault domains and AZs.-->

### Requirements

- **Region support:** Zone-spanning and zonal scale sets can be deployed into [any region that supports availability zones](./regions-list.md).

    [!INCLUDE [VM -Virtual machines zone region support](includes/virtual-machines/zone-region-support-include.md)]

    If a particular VM SKU isn't available in of the zones you select for your scale set, then your scale set might not be able to scale out to meet your capacity requirements.

- **Dedicated hosts:** Azure Dedicated Host deployments don't support zone-spanning or zonal scale sets.

- **Types:** Availability zone support is available with all types of scale sets, including Flexible and Uniform scale sets.

### Considerations


- **Fault domain spreading:** When your scale set uses availability zones, there are implications for the fault domain spreading configuration you can apply. However, we recommend you use max spreading for most workloads, which uses as many fault domains as possible. For more information, see [Choosing the right number of fault domains for Virtual Machine Scale Set](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-manage-fault-domains).

- **Zone balancing:** Zone balancing refers to whether the scale set's VM instances are evenly distributed across the zones you select. A scale set is considered *balanced* if each zone has the same number of VMs ±1 VM. You can configure the scale set's zone balancing mode to be best-effort or strict. This configuration affects whether the scale set is allowed to scale out in an unbalanced way, including in a zone-down scenario. For more information, see [Zone balancing in scale sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-zone-balancing).

- **Placement groups:** For Uniform scale sets, if you configure multiple [placement groups](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-placement-groups), Azure deploys multiple placement groups in each zone your scale set uses.

### Cost

There's no cost difference between a zone-spanning, zonal, and nonzonal scale set with the same number and type of VM instances.

### Configure availability zone support

This section explains how to configure availability zone support for your scale set.

- **Create a zone-spanning or zonal scale set.** You can configure availability zones when you create a new scale set. You can create a zonal or zone-spanning scale set. For detailed instructions, see [Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set that uses availability zones](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones).

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [Availability zone numbering](./includes/reliability-availability-zone-numbering-include.md)]

- **Convert existing scale sets to use availability zones.** You can convert an existing nonzonal (regional) scale set to use availability zones. For detailed instructions, see [Update scale set to add availability zones](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones#update-scale-set-to-add-availability-zones).

- **Change the availability zone configuration of an existing scale set.** You can add zones to an existing scale set, but you can't remove zones. For detailed instructions, see [Update scale set to add availability zones](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-use-availability-zones#update-scale-set-to-add-availability-zones).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you expand the scale set to additional zones, the original VM instances are not immediately migrated or changed. When you scale out, new instances are created and spread evenly across the selected availability zones. Data from the original instances are not migrated to the new zones. When you scale in the scale set, any regional instances will be priorized for removal first. After that, instances will be removed based on the [scale-in policy](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy).

### Capacity planning and management

To prepare for availability zone failure, consider *over-provisioning* the number of VM instances in your scale set. This approach allows the solution to tolerate some capacity loss and continue to function without degraded performance, ensuring that the remaining zones have sufficient capacity to handle full production load. For more information, see [Manage capacity by using over-provisioning](/azure/reliability/concept-redundancy-replication-backup#manage-capacity-with-over-provisioning).

### Behavior when all zones are healthy

This section describes what to expect when scale sets are configured with availability zone support and all availability zones are operational.

- **Traffic routing between zones**. You're responsible for routing traffic between VMs in the scale set, including VMs that are in different availability zones. Common approaches include Azure Load Balancer and Azure Application Gateway, which provide built-in integration with scale sets. For more information, see [Networking for Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-networking).

- **Data replication between zones**. You're responsible for any data replication that needs to happen between VMs, including across VMs in different availability zones. Databases and other similar stateful applications that run on VMs often provide capabilities to replicate data.

### Behavior during a zone failure

This section describes what to expect when scale sets are configured with availability zone support and there's an outage in their availability zones.

- **Detection and response**. You're responsible for detecting the loss of an availability zone and deciding how to respond.

    For zone-spanning scale sets, any VM instances in the affected zone might be unavailable. Instances in the healthy zones remain operational.

    For zonal scale sets deployed in the affected zone, all of the VM instances might be unavailable. You need to plan how you respond to a zone failure. For example, you might redirect traffic to another scale set in a different zone or region.

[!INCLUDE [Availability zone down notification (Service Health and Resource Health)](./includes/reliability-availability-zone-down-notification-service-resource-include.md)]

- **Active requests**. Any active requests or other work that occurs on VMs in the affected availability zone are likely to be terminated.

- **Expected data loss**. Zonal VM disks might be unavailable during a zone failure.

    If you use zone-redundant storage (ZRS) disks and an outage affects your VM, you can [force detach](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/attach-detach-data-disks?tabs=HTTP#diskdetachoptiontypes) your ZRS disks from the failed VM. This approach allows you to attach the ZRS disks to another VM.

- **Expected downtime**. Any VMs in the affected zone remain down until the availability zone recovers. When you use zone-spanning scale sets, VMs that are located in in healthy zones continue to work.

- **Traffic rerouting**. You're responsible for rerouting traffic to other VMs in healthy zones.

    If you configure a zone-resilient load balancer and it performs health checks, the load balancer typically detects failed VMs and can route traffic to other VM instances in healthy zones.

- **Instance replacement.** Virtual Machine Scale Sets doesn't automatically add new instances into healthy zones.

    If you have a zone-spanning scale set, you can scale out to add more instances to the affected zone. If the scale set uses [strict zone balancing](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-zone-balancing), the scale set blocks scale-out operations if doing so causes an imbalance.

   >[!TIP] 
   >It's a good practice to configure [autoscale](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-overview) rules based on CPU or memory usage. The autoscale rules can allow the scale set to respond to a loss of the VM instances in a zone by scaling out to add new instances in the remaining operational zones.

### Zone recovery

[!INCLUDE [VM -Virtual machines zone recovery](includes/virtual-machines/zone-recovery-include.md)]

If you add temporary instances to your scale set during a zone failure, when the zone is restored, you may need to scale down your scale set to the original capacity.

### Test for zone failures

You can use Azure Chaos Studio to simulate the loss of VMs in one or more availability zones as part of an experiment. Chaos Studio provides [built-in faults for scale sets](/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-fault-library#virtual-machine-scale-set), including the ability to shut down VMs in specific zones. You can use these capabilities to simulate zone-level failures and test your failover processes.

## Resilience to region-wide failures

Scale sets are single-region resources. If the region is unavailable, any scale sets in the region are also unavailable.

### Custom multi-region solutions for resiliency

You can deploy multiple scale sets into different regions, but you need to implement replication, load balancing, and failover processes. For example, you might deploy identical scale sets in multiple regions, and use Azure Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager with health probes to route traffic. You're responsible for replicating state by using application mechanisms or managed data services.

## Backup and restore

[!INCLUDE [VM -Virtual machines backups](includes/virtual-machines/backup-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Backups include](includes/reliability-backups-include.md)]

## Resilience to VM reconfiguration

Scale sets provide you with control over how you apply configuration changes to your VMs, including changing your VM SKU, changing the image each VM uses, and adding or removing VM extensions. You can control the *upgrade policy mode*, which determines how upgrades are applied. For more information, see [Upgrade policy modes for Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-upgrade-policy).

Some upgrade types can require reimaging or redeploying an instance. If you have specific instances that must be excluded from automatic upgrades, such as instances that contain state that you need to preserve or configuration you can't replicate on other instances, consider using [instance protection](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-instance-protection).

## Resilience to service maintenance

Azure periodically performs updates to improve the reliability, performance, and security of the host infrastructure for VMs. Scale sets provide you with multiple ways to understand and control planned maintenance:

- [Planned maintenance notifications](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-maintenance-notifications) tell you when maintenance is due, and gives you control over when the maintenance takes place.

- [Maintenance configurations](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-configurations) let you schedule a maintenance window at a time that suits your business needs.

- [Scheduled events for Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/scheduled-events) and [for Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/scheduled-events) gives your application time to prepare for virtual machine (VM) maintenance. It provides information about upcoming maintenance events (for example, reboot) so that your application can prepare for them and limit disruption. 

## Service-level agreement

[!INCLUDE [SLA description](includes/reliability-service-level-agreement-include.md)]

Virtual machine scale sets share the availability SLA for virtual machines. You can achieve a higher uptime percentage for your VMs by using a scale set that meets both of the following criteria:

- Contains two or more instances.
- Spread those instances across two or more availability zones.
