# Configure a cache volume for Azure NetApp Files (preview)

The purpose of this article is to provide users of Azure NetApp Files with cache volumes that simplify file distribution, reduce WAN latency, and lower WAN/ExpressRoute bandwidth costs. Azure NetApp Files cache volumes are currently designed to be peered with external sources--origin volumes in on-premises ONTAP, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or Amazon FSx for NetApp.

Azure NetApp Files cache volumes are cloud-based caches of an external origin volume, containing only the most actively accessed data on the volume. Cache volumes accept both reads and writes but operate at faster speeds with reduced latency. When a cache volume receives a read request of the hot data it contains, it can respond faster than the origin volume because the data doesn't need to travel as far to reach the client. If a cache volume receives a read request for infrequently read data (cold data), it retrieves the needed data from the origin volume and then stores the data before serving the client request. Subsequent read requests for that data are then served directly from the cache volume. After the first request, the data no longer needs to travel across the network or be served from a heavily loaded system.

Write-back allows the write to be committed to stable storage at the cache and acknowledges the client without waiting for the data to make it to the origin. This results in a globally distributed file system that enables writes to perform at near-local speeds for specific workloads and environments, offering significant performance benefits whereas write-around waits for the origin to commit the writes to the stable storage before acknowledging the client. This results in every write incurring the penalty of traversing the network between the cache and origin.  

## Considerations

* Cache volumes are currently only supported with the REST API. 
* The delegated subnet address space for hosting the Azure NetApp Files volumes must have at least seven free IP addresses: six for cluster peering and one for data access to one or more cache volumes.
    * Ensure that the delegated subnet address space is sized appropriately to accommodate the Azure NetApp Files network interfaces. Review the [guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](azure-netapp-files-network-topologies.md) to ensure you meet the requirements for delegated subnet sizing.
* When creating each cache volume, the Azure NetApp Files volume placement algorithm attempts to reuse the same Azure NetApp Files storage system as any previously created cache volumes in the subscription. This is done to try to reduce the number of NICs/IPs consumed in the delegated subnet. If this isn't possible, another 6+1 NICs are consumed.
* You can't use the same source cluster for multiple subscriptions for creating cache volumes in the same availability zone in the same region. 
* If enabling write-back on the external origin volume:
    * You must be running ONTAP 9.15.1P5 or later on the system hosting the external origin volume. 
    * Each external origin system node has at least 128GB of RAM and 20 CPUs to absorb the write-back messages initiated by write-back enabled caches. This is the equivalent of an A400 or greater. If the origin cluster serves as the origin to multiple write-back enabled Azure NetApp Files cache volumes, it requires more CPUs and RAM.
    * Testing is executed for files smaller than 100GB and WAN round-trip times between the cache and origin not exceeding 100 ms. Any workloads outside of these limits might result in unexpected performance characteristics.
    * The external origin must remain less than 80% full. Cache volumes aren't granted exclusive lock delegations if there isn't at least 20% space remaining in the origin volume. Calls to a write-back-enabled cache are forwarded to the origin in this situation. This helps prevent running out of space at the origin, which would result in leaving dirty data orphaned at a write-back-enabled cache.
    * You shouldn't configure qtree, user, or group quotas at an origin volume with write-back enabled cache volumes. This may incur a significant latency increase.
* You should be aware of the supported and unsupported features for cache volumes in Azure NetApp Files.
    * Unsupported features:
        * NFSv4.2
        * Ransomware protection
        * FlexCache disaster recovery
        * S3 Buckets
        * Azure NetApp Files backup
        * Cross-region, cross-zone, and cross-zone-region replication
        * Snapshot policies
        * Application Volume Groups
    * Supported features:
        * NFS, SMB, and dual protocols
        * Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
        * Kerberos
        * Availability zone volume placement
        * Customer-managed keys
* The Azure NetApp Files cache volume must be deployed in an availability zone. To populate a new or existing volume in an availability zone, see [Manage availability zones in Azure NetApp Files](manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md). 
* Cache volumes only support Standard network features. Basic network features can't be configured on cache volumes. 
* When creating a cache volume, ensure that there's sufficient space in the capacity pool to accommodate the new cache volume.
* You can't move a cache volume to another capacity pool.
* You can't transition noncustomer managed key cache volumes to customer managed key (CMK).
* You should ensure that the protocol type is the same for the cache volume and origin volume. The security style and the Unix permissions are inherited from the origin volume. For example, creating a cache volume with NFSv3 or NFSv4 when origin is UNIX, and SMB when the origin is NTFS.
* You should enable encryption on the origin volume.
* You should configure an Active Directory (AD) or LDAP connection within the NetApp account to create an LDAP-enabled cache volume.
* The `globalFileLocking` parameter value must be the same on all cache volumes that share the same origin volume. Global file locking can be enabled when creating the first cache volume by setting `globalFileLocking` to true. The subsequent cache volumes from the same origin volume must have this setting set to true. To change the global file locking setting on existing cache volumes, you must update the origin volume first and then the change will propagate to all the cache volumes associated with that origin volume. The `volume flexcache origin config modify -is-global-file-locking-enabled` command should be executed on the source cluster to change the setting on the origin volume.

## Register the feature

Cache volumes for Azure NetApp Files are currently in preview. You need to register the feature before using it for the first time. After registration, the feature is enabled and works in the background. 

1. Register the feature: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFCacheVolumesExternal 
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to`Registered`. Wait until the status is **Registered** before continuing.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFCacheVolumesExternal 
    ```

You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status.

## Before you begin

You must create Express Route or VPN resources to ensure network connectivity from the external NetApp ONTAP cluster to the target Azure NetApp Files cluster. The connectivity can be accomplished in many ways with the goal being that the source cluster has connectivity to the Azure NetApp Files delegated subnet. Connectivity includes this set of firewall rules (bidirectional for all):

* ICMP
* TCP 11104 
* TCP 11105 
* HTTPS
  

The network connectivity must be in place for all intercluster (IC) LIFs on the source cluster to all IC LIFs on the Azure NetApp Files endpoint.

## Create a cache volume

1.	Initiate the cache volume creation using the PUT caches API call.

2.  Monitor if the cache state is available for cluster peering using the GET caches API call.

    When the cacheState = ClusterPeeringOfferSent, execute the POST listPeeringPassphrases call to obtain the command and passphrase necessary to complete the cluster peering.

    Example listPeeringPassphrases output:

    ```
    {
    "clusterPeeringCommand": "cluster peer create -ipspace <IP-SPACE-NAME> -encryption-protocol-proposed tls-psk -peer-addrs 1.1.1.1,1.1.1.2,1.1.1.3,1.1.1.4,1.1.1.5,1.1.1.6",
    "cachePeeringPassphraseExample": "AUniquePassphrase",
    "vserverPeeringCommand": "vserver peer accept -vserver vserver1 -peer-vserver cache_volume_svm"
    }
    ```
    Execute the clusterPeeringCommand on the ONTAP system that contains the external origin volume and when prompted, enter the clusterPeeringPassphrase.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The user will have 30 minutes after the cacheState transitions to "ClusterPeeringOfferSent" to complete execution of the clusterPeeringCommand.  If 30 minutes is exceeded, then cache creation fails and the user will need to delete the cache volume and initiate a new PUT call.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace "IP-SPACE-NAME" with the ipspace that the IC LIFs use on the external origin volume’s ONTAP system.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Don't execute the vserverPeeringCommand at this time.  This will be executed in the next step.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If cache volumes are already created using this ONTAP system, then the existing cluster peer is reused. There can be situations where a different Azure NetApp Files cluster may be used which would require a new cluster peer.

3.	Monitor if the cache state is available for Vserver peering using the GET caches API call.

    When the cacheState = VserverPeeringOfferSent, go to the ONTAP system that contains the external origin volume and execute the “vserver peer show” command until an entry appears where the Remote Vserver = <value of the -peer-vserver in the vserverPeeringCommand>. The Peer State shows "pending".

    Execute the vserverPeeringCommand on the ONTAP system that contains the external origin volume.  The Peer State should transition to "peered".

    > [!NOTE]
    > The user has 12 minutes after the cacheState transitions to "VserverPeeringOfferSent" to complete execution of the vserverPeeringCommand. If 12 minutes is exceeded, then cache creation fails, and the user will need to delete the cache volume and initiate a new PUT call.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If cache volumes are already created using this ONTAP system and the cluster peer was reused, then the existing vserver peer may be reused. If that happens, then step 3 will be skipped and the next step will be executed.

4.	Complete the cache volume creation.

    Once the peering is complete, the cache volume is created. Monitor the cacheState and provisioningState of the cache volume using the GET caches API call. When the cacheState and provisioningState transition to "Succeeded," the cache volume is ready for use.

## Update a cache volume

Example patch request body to update a cache volume:

```
{
  "properties": {
    "writeBack": "Disabled"
  }
}
```

## Delete a cache volume

You can delete a cache volume if it's no longer required using the delete cache API call.

If the cache volume has writeBack enabled, then a patch call needs to be made first to disable writeBack, then the delete call can be made.
