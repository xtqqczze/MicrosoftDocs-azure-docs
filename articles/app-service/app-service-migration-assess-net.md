# At-scale assessment of .NET web apps

Once you've discovered ASP.NET web apps, you should proceed to the next step of assessing these web apps. Assessment provides you with migration readiness and sizing recommendations based on properties defined by you. 

## Key assessment capabilities 

- Modify assessment properties according to your requirements, like target Azure region, application isolation requirements, and reserved instance pricing.
- Provide App Service SKU recommendation and display monthly cost estimates.
- Provide migration readiness information per web app and provide detailed information on blockers and errors.

You can create multiple assessments for the same web apps with different sets of assessment properties.
