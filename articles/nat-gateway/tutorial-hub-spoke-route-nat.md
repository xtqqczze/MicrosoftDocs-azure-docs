# Tutorial: Use a NAT gateway with a hub and spoke network

A hub and spoke network is one of the building blocks of a highly available multiple location network infrastructure. The most common deployment of a hub and spoke network is done with the intention of routing all inter-spoke and outbound internet traffic through the central hub. The purpose is to inspect all of the traffic traversing the network with a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) for security scanning and packet inspection.

For outbound traffic to the internet, the network virtual appliance would typically have one network interface with an assigned public IP address. The NVA after inspecting the outbound traffic forwards the traffic out the public interface and to the internet. Azure NAT Gateway eliminates the need for the public IP address assigned to the NVA. Associating a NAT gateway with the public subnet of the NVA changes the routing for the public interface to route all outbound internet traffic through the NAT gateway. The elimination of the public IP address increases security and allows for the scaling of outbound source network address translation (SNAT) with multiple public IP addresses and or public IP prefixes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Standard V2 SKU Azure NAT Gateway is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NVA used in this article is for demonstration purposes only and is simulated with an Ubuntu virtual machine. The solution doesn't include a load balancer for high availability of the NVA deployment. Replace the Ubuntu virtual machine in this article with an NVA of your choice. Consult the vendor of the chosen NVA for routing and configuration instructions. A load balancer and availability zones are recommended for a highly available NVA infrastructure.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a NAT gateway.
> * Create a hub and spoke virtual network.
> * Create a simulated Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).
> * Force all traffic from the spokes through the hub.
> * Force all internet traffic in the hub and the spokes out the NAT gateway.
> * Test the NAT gateway and inter-spoke routing.

# [**Powershell**](#tab/powershell)

Use [New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworksecuritygroup) to create the network security group.

```powershell
$nsgParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "nsg-nva"
    Location = "westus"
}
New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup @nsgParams
```

Use [New-AzNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznetworkinterface) to create the network interface.

```powershell
$nicParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "nic-public"
    SubnetId = (Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName "test-rg" -Name "vnet-hub").Subnets[1].Id
    NetworkSecurityGroupId = (Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName "test-rg" -Name "nsg-nva").Id
    Location = "westus"
}
New-AzNetworkInterface @nicParams
```

Use [Get-Credential](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/get-credential) to set a user name and password for the VM and store them in the `$cred` variable.

```azurepowershell
$cred = Get-Credential
```

> [!NOTE]
> A username is required for the VM. The password is optional and won't be used if set. SSH key configuration is recommended for Linux VMs.

Use [New-AzVMConfig](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvmconfig) to define a VM.

```azurepowershell
$vmConfigParams = @{
    VMName = "vm-nva"
    VMSize = "Standard_DS4_v2"
    }
$vmConfig = New-AzVMConfig @vmConfigParams
```

Use [Set-AzVMOperatingSystem](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmoperatingsystem) and [Set-AzVMSourceImage](/powershell/module/az.compute/set-azvmsourceimage) to create the rest of the VM configuration. The following example creates an Ubuntu Server virtual machine:

```azurepowershell
$osParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    ComputerName = "vm-nva"
    Credential = $cred
    }
$vmConfig = Set-AzVMOperatingSystem @osParams -Linux -DisablePasswordAuthentication

$imageParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    PublisherName = "Canonical"
    Offer = "ubuntu-24_04-lts"
    Skus = "server"
    Version = "latest"
    }
$vmConfig = Set-AzVMSourceImage @imageParams
```

Use [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface) to attach the NIC that you previously created to the VM.

```azurepowershell
# Get the network interface object
$nicParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "nic-public"
    }
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @nicParams

$vmConfigParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    Id = $nic.Id
    }
$vmConfig = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface @vmConfigParams
```

Use [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) to create the VM. The command will generate SSH keys for the virtual machine for login. Make note of the location of the private key. The private key is needed in later steps for connecting to the virtual machine with Azure Bastion.

```azurepowershell
$vmParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Location = "westus"
    SshKeyName = "ssh-key"
    }
New-AzVM @vmParams -GenerateSshKey
```

    PrivateIpAddress = "10.0.0.10"
    Location = "westus"
}
New-AzNetworkInterface @nicParams
```

Use [Stop-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/stop-azvm) to shutdown and deallocate the virtual machine.

```powershell
$vmParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "vm-nva"
    Force = $true
}
Stop-AzVM @vmParams
```

Use [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface) to attach the secondary network interface to the virtual machine.

```powershell
$vmParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "vm-nva"
}
$vm = Get-AzVM @vmParams

$nicParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "nic-private"
}
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @nicParams

$vm = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id

$updateParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    VM = $vm
}
Update-AzVM @updateParams
```

Use [Start-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/start-azvm) to start the virtual machine.

    Offer = "WindowsServer"
    Skus = "2022-Datacenter"
    Version = "latest"
    }
$vmConfig = Set-AzVMSourceImage @imageParams
```

Use [Add-AzVMNetworkInterface](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvmnetworkinterface) to attach the NIC that you previously created to the VM.

```azurepowershell
# Get the network interface object
$nicParams = @{
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
    Name = "nic-1"
    }
$nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface @nicParams

$vmConfigParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    Id = $nic.Id
    }
$vmConfig = Add-AzVMNetworkInterface @vmConfigParams
```

Use [New-AzVM](/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm) to create the VM.

```azurepowershell
$vmParams = @{
    VM = $vmConfig
    ResourceGroupName = "test-rg"
