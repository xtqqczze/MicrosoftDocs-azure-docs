# Reliability and availability zones in Azure Deployment Environments
This article describes reliability support in Azure Deployment Environments. It covers intra-regional resiliency with availability zones and inter-region resiliency with disaster recovery. For a more detailed overview of reliability in Azure, see [Azure reliability](/azure/well-architected/reliability/).

## Availability zone support
[Availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli) are physically separate groups of datacenters within an Azure region. When one zone fails, services can fail over to one of the remaining zones.

Azure Deployment Environments automatically support availability zones for all resources. You don't need to take any action.

The following regions support both Deployment Environments and availability zones:

- Australia East
- Brazil South
- Canada Central
- Central India
- Central US
- East Asia
- East US
- East US 2
- Germany West Central
- Italy North
- Japan East
- Korea Central
- North Europe
- Spain Central
- South Africa North
- South Central US
- Southeast Asia
- Sweden Central
- Switzerland North
- UK South
- West Europe
- West US 2
- West US 3

## Cross-region disaster recovery and business continuity
Disaster recovery (DR) refers to practices that organizations use to recover from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR. Before you start creating your disaster recovery plan, see [Recommendations for designing a disaster recovery strategy](/azure/well-architected/reliability/disaster-recovery).

For DR, Microsoft uses the [shared responsibility model](/azure/reliability/concept-shared-responsibility). In this model, Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available. However, many Azure services don't automatically replicate data or fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. For those services, you're responsible for setting up a disaster recovery plan that works for your workload. Most services that run on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) offerings provide features and guidance to support DR. You can use [service-specific features to support fast recovery](/azure/reliability/overview-reliability-guidance) to help develop your DR plan.

You can replicate the following Deployment Environments resources in an alternate region to prevent data loss if a cross-region failover occurs:

- Dev centers
- Projects
- Catalogs
- Catalog items
- Dev center environment types
- Project environment types
- Environments
