> [!NOTE]
> If you need to manage enterprise-wide PaaS resources, policies, and security settings, or CI/CD integration across deployment stages and applications, consider using Azure Deployment Environments (ADE) to create environments. ADE lets developers rapidly deploy app infrastructure using project-based templates, ensuring consistent and secure environments for your development teams. For more information, see the [Azure Deployment Environments documentation](../../deployment-environments/index.yml).
