# Register MCP servers hosted in Azure Functions in Azure API Center

After hosting your MCP server remotely on Azure Functions, you can register it on Azure API Center, which maintains an inventory (or registry) of remote MCP servers so that they're easily discoverable across your organization. All registered MCP servers can be found in the API Center portal for teams in your organization.

## Create resources 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal, then [create an Azure API Center resource](../api-center/set-up-api-center.md) if you don't already have one. 

   > [!TIP]
   > The API Center name becomes your private tool catalog name in the registry filter. Choose an informative name that helps users identify your organization's tool catalog.

1. [Create an environment](../api-center/tutorials/configure-environments-deployments.md#add-an-environment) in your API Center resource. For **server type**, pick "Azure Functions". 

## Register MCP server 

1. Register your remote MCP server by adding it as an API:

   a. In the left navigation pane of the API Center resource, select **APIs**.

   b. Select **+ Register an API**. The following table provides example values for the required settings. You can also fill in the optional settings like MCP server description, repository, external documentation, etc. which will be information displayed in the API Center portal. 
    
    | Setting  | Value |
    |----------|----------|
    | API Title   | Enter a descriptive name for the MCP server, like _Weather MCP Server_ |
    | Identification | This is autogenerated based on the API Title, but it can be modified.|
    | API type    | Pick "MCP"   |
    | **MCP** ||
    | Runtime URL | Enter MCP server endpoint, e.g. `https://my-server-app-name.azurewebsites.net/mcp` |
    | Environment| Pick the one created earlier |
    | **Version** | |
    | Version title | Enter a version title of your choice, such as "v1" |
    | Version identification | After you enter the preceding title, Azure API Center generates this identifier, which you can override. | 
    | Version lifecyle| Make a selection from the dropdown, for example, _Testing_ or _Production_. |

    c. Click **Create**

    You should now see the MCP server registered as an API on the list. 

## Update server definition
1. Create an API definition for a remote MCP server in OpenAPI 3.0 format. This definition is required so that the URL endpoint of the MCP server is visible in the API Center portal. Save the definition somewhere you can access. You'll need to upload it in the next step. 

    Example OpenAI 3.0 API definition for the MCP server:
    ```json
    {
        "openapi": "3.0.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Weather MCP server",
            "description": "MCP server with tools returning weather forecast and alerts.",
            "version": "1.0"
        },
        "servers": [
            {
                "url": "https://my-mcp-server.azurewebsites.net/mcp"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Update the server definition: 

    a. On the left menu, find **Assets -> APIs**.
    
    b. Click the MCP server name to open up the registration.
    
    c. On the left menu, find **Details -> Versions**.
    
    d. Under "Version", find and uncollapse "v1". Then click on **Streamable Definition for...** to open the definition
    
    d. Click **Replace**. 
    
    e. In the side pane that opens up, change the "Specification version" to 3.0, then upload the definition from the last step. 

    f. Click **Replace** button on the bottom.

## Set up API Center portal

1. [Set up the portal](../api-center/set-up-api-center-portal.md) if you don't already have one. 

1. Once the portal is set up, it's accessible at `https://<service-name>.portal.<location>.azure-apicenter.ms`, replacing `<service-name>` and `<location>` with the name of your API center and the location where it's deployed. You'll need to sign in to see registered MCP servers. 

1. Clicking into a server name opens a pane that shows information based on data provided during server registration and the uploaded API definition.Users with access to the portal can connect to servers of their choice by copying the endpoint URL or the install in Visual Studio Code integration.
