You can configure multiple monitors for your dev box to work on multiple tasks at the same time, such as debugging and writing code. You can also use multiple monitors to view different applications side by side.

To enable multiple monitors:

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal) and select the **Settings** icon at top right.
