# Responsible AI FAQ for Azure Load Testing

## What is Azure Load Testing?

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that enables developers and testers to generate high-scale load on their applications to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure reliability. It helps simulate real-world traffic and provides insights into how applications behave under stress. Azure Load Testing leverages advanced analytics and integrates with Azure Monitor to provide comprehensive performance metrics. All of this is carried out within the framework of Azure’s steadfast commitment to safeguarding the customer's data security and privacy. For an overview of how Azure Load Testing works and a summary of its capabilities, see [Azure Load Testing overview](overview-what-is-azure-load-testing.md).

## What can Azure Load Testing do?  

Azure Load Testing can help you author, run, and analyze load tests for your applications. It generates load to your end point and provides insights into application performance and scalability. Azure Load Testing uses AI to help you author tests by providing recommendations on recorded scenarios to convert into load test scripts. It also uses AI to help you analyze test results by identifying potential performance bottlenecks and suggesting optimizations.

## What are Azure Load Testing’s intended use(s)? 

Azure Load Testing is designed to help developers and testers simulate real-world traffic and identify performance bottlenecks in their applications. It provides detailed analytics and integrates with Azure Monitor to offer comprehensive performance metrics, enabling users to ensure the reliability and scalability of their applications.

## How was Azure Load Testing evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? 

Azure Load Testing was evaluated through extensive manual and automatic testing on top of Microsoft internal usage and public data. More evaluation was performed over custom datasets for offensive and malicious prompts (user questions) and responses. In addition, Azure Load Testing is continuously evaluated with user online feedback.

## What are the limitations of Azure Load Testing? How can users minimize the impact of Azure Load Testing’s limitations when using the system? 

Azure Load Testing's AI functionalities work only in English language. The suggestions for enhancement of test script and test run insights are from AI, which can sometimes make mistakes, misinterpret facts and/or produce inaccurate results. We highly recommend users to review the suggestions before accepting them.


## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of Azure Load Testing? 

Azure Load Testing has been reviewed by our Responsible AI (RAI) team. We follow RAI principles and have implemented:

- Responsible AI handling pipeline to mitigate the risks like harmful, inappropriate content.

- In product user feedback with which users can report offensive content back to Microsoft.


## How do I provide feedback on Azure Load Testing? 

All AI experiences in Azure Load Testing have an in-product feedback mechanism. You can provide feedback by clicking on the "Give feedback" button within the Azure Load Testing interface. This feedback is invaluable for us to improve the service and address any issues you may encounter.
