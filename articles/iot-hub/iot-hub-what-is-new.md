# What is new in Azure IoT Hub? (preview)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-public-preview-banner](includes/public-preview-banner.md)]

Starting November 2025, Azure IoT Hub introduces two new **preview** features: integration with Azure Device Registry (ADR) and enhanced Microsoft-backed X.509 certificate management. These features are designed to improve security, simplify device management, and streamline operations for IoT deployments.

## Manage your devices in a unified registry with Azure Device Registry

IoT Hub now integrates directly with Azure Device Registry (ADR) to bring a consistent experience across cloud and edge workloads. ADR is a centralized device registry that allows you to manage IoT devices across IoT Hub and IoT Operations instances using namespaces. You can link your IoT instances to either a new or an existing ADR namespace. Integration of IoT Hub with ADR is essential to leverage the latest enhancements in device provisioning, certificate management, and deeper integration with Azure Resource Manager.

For more information, see [What is Azure Device Registry?](iot-hub-device-registry-overview.md).

## Manage your X.509 credentials with certificate management

IoT Hub now introduces certificate management for managing device certificates using Microsoft-managed public key infrastructure (PKI) with X.509 certificates. Certificate management is an optional feature of ADR that enables you to issue and manage X.509 certificates for your IoT devices. It configures a dedicated, cloud-based PKI for each of your ADR namespaces, without requiring any on-premises servers, connectors, or hardware. It handles the certificate of issuance and renewal for all IoT devices that have been provisioned to that ADR namespace. These X.509 certificates can be used for your IoT devices to authenticate with IoT Hub.

These X.509 certificates are strictly operational certificates that the device uses to authenticate with IoT Hub for secure communications, after the device has onboarded with a different credential. 

To use certificate management, devices must be provisioned through [Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](../iot-dps/index.yml). 

For more information, see [What is certificate management?](iot-hub-certificate-management-overview.md) and [Key concepts for certificate management](iot-hub-certificate-management-concepts.md).
