<a name="agent-workflows-billing"></a>

## Billing

- Consumption: Billing uses the pay-as-you-go model. Agent loop pricing is based on the number of tokens that each agent action uses and appears as Enterprise Units on your bill. For specific pricing information see [Azure Logic Apps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/).

- Standard: Although agent workflows don't incur extra charges, AI model usage incurs charges. For more information, see the Azure [Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
