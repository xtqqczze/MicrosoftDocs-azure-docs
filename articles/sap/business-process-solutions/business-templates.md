## Copilot agent

Agents enable users to use natural language to interact with business processes and data. They can ask both operational and analytical questions, and the agent, based on context, will either use the Data Agent within Microsoft Fabric or send a request directly to the source system. Beyond data retrieval, agents can act as system users, interacting with applications on the user’s behalf to perform tasks and surface insights. This allows them also to proactively provide recommendations, highlight anomalies, and guide decision-making.

For example, Researcher can analyze patterns across finance, sales, and procurement to uncover root causes of performance issues, identify dependencies between processes, or highlight opportunities for optimization. By combining this deeper analysis with real-time operational signals, agents enable organizations to move from reactive reporting to proactive, insight-driven action.
