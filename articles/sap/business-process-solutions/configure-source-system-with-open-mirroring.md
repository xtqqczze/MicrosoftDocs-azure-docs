# Configure SAP source system with Open Mirroring

This article describes how to configure SAP S/4HANA and SAP ECC source systems using Open Mirroring. In this scenario, Business Process Solutions processes the extracted data, while data ingestion is handled by third-party tools. Data extraction should be configured directly within your chosen extraction solution.

Use the following steps to configure your SAP S/4 HANA source system with Open Mirroring.

1. On the home screen, click on **Configure source system** button.
2. Click on the **New source system** button.
