# Acompany 

## Overview 

Acompany provides confidential computing as a strategic security foundation on Microsoft Azure. Customers use our technology to operate privacy-preserving data clean rooms for a Fortune Global 500 telecom company, optimize manufacturing analytics, and support mission-critical national security initiatives. 

 See our Azure Marketplace offer: [Auto-Privacy DataCleanRoom](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/acompany.autoprivacy-datacleanroom). 

## Auto-Privacy DataCleanRoom 
Auto-Privacy DataCleanRoom (DCR) is a ready-to-use solution for secure data collaboration. It enables multiple parties to combine and analyze data without exposing raw datasets. All computation runs inside Azure confidential computing environments (trusted execution environments, TEEs). DCR supports privacy-aligned workflows in Japan and connects to your existing data warehouses (DWHs), customer data platforms (CDPs), and data management platforms (DMPs). 

DCR implements Acompany’s nested attestation to verify trust—from the Azure platform through the runtime to each workload component—before code is allowed to run. 

Highlights: 

- Confidential by design: Workloads run inside hardware-based enclaves to protect data in use. 

- Fast adoption: Integrates with current analytics and marketing stacks; no need to replatform. 

- Enterprise-proven: In production with a Fortune Global 500 company.

## Research behind our products 

Our work on nested attestation for confidential serverless computing on Intel® SGX is the foundation of DCR’s trust model. Unlike approaches that rely on sandboxing inside the enclave, we use Key Separation and Sharing (KSS) to bind workloads to immutable enclave IDs and prevent reuse. This helps DCR verify each component and maintain a clear chain of trust.
