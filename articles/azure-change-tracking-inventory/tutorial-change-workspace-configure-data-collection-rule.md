# Tutorial: Change a workspace and configure data collection rule

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows Registry :heavy_check_mark: Windows Files :heavy_check_mark: Linux Files :heavy_check_mark: Windows Software

This tutorial describes how to change a workspace and configure data collection rule.

## Prerequisites

Before you change a workspace for your virtual machine and configure data collection rule, ensure you meet this prerequisite:

You've enabled Change Tracking and Inventory on your VM. For detailed information on how you can create a Data Collection Rule (DCR), see [Create DCR](create-data-collection-rule.md).

## Configure Windows, Linux files, and Windows Registry using Data Collection Rules

To configure Windows, Linux files, and Windows Registry using Data Collection Rules, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the virtual machine.
1. Select a specific VM for which you would like to configure the Change tracking settings.
1. Under **Operations**, select **Change tracking**.

1. Select **Settings** to view the **Data Collection Rule Configuration** (DCR) pane. Here, you can do the following actions:
   1. Configure changes on a VM at a granular level.  
   1. Select the filter to configure the workspace.
   1. Use the filter to view all the DCRs that are configured to the specific LA workspace level.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The settings that you configure apply to all virtual machines associated with the specified DCR. For more information about DCR, see [Data collection rules in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview).

1. Select **Add** to configure new file settings. Use the procedure as specified for Windows and Linux files.
   
   #### [Windows Files](#tab/windows)

    On the **Add Windows File setting** pane, enter the information for the file or folder to track and select **Save**. The following table describes the properties that you can use to enter the information.

    |**Property**|**Description**|
    |---|---|
    |Enabled | True if the setting is applied, and false otherwise.|
    |Item Name | Friendly name of the file to be tracked. | 
    |Group | A group name to group files logically| 
    |Path | The path to check for the file, for example, **c:\temp\*.txt.** You can also use environment variables, such as %winDir%\System32\\\*.*. 
    |Path Type | The type of path. Possible values are File and Folder.|
    |Recursion | True if recursion is used when looking for the item to be tracked, and False otherwise. |

   #### [Linux Files](#tab/linux)

    On the **Add Linux File for Change Tracking** pane, enter the information for the file or directory to track, and then select **Save**. The following table describes the properties that you can use to enter the information. 
    
    |**Property**|**Description**|
    |---|---|
    |Enabled | True if the setting is applied, and false otherwise.|
    |Item Name | Friendly name of the file to be tracked. | 
    |Group | A group name to group files logically| 
    |Path | The path to check for the file, for example, /etc/*.conf.  
    |Path Type | The type of path. Possible values are File and Folder.|
    |Recursion | True if recursion is used when looking for the item to be tracked, and False otherwise. |
   
---

You can now view the virtual machines configured to the DCR.


### Configure file content changes

To configure file content changes, follow these steps:

1. In your virtual machine, under **Operations**, select **Change tracking** > **Settings**.
1. On the **Data Collection Rule Configuration (Preview)** pane, select **File Content** > **Link** to link the storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-change-workspace-configure-data-collection-rule/file-content-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting the link option to connect with the Storage account." lightbox="media/tutorial-change-workspace-configure-data-collection-rule/file-content-expanded.png":::

1. In **Content Location for Change Tracking** pane, select your **Subscription**, **Storage** and confirm if you are using **System Assigned Managed Identity**. 
1. Select **Upload file content for all settings**, and then select **Save** to ensure that the file content changes for all the files residing in this DCR are tracked.

#### [System Assigned Managed Identity](#tab/sa-mi)

When the storage account is linked using the system assigned managed identity, a blob is created. For system-assigned managed identity, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Storage accounts**, and select the storage account.
1. On the **Storage accounts** pane, under **Data storage**, select **Containers** > **Changetracking blob** > **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. On the **Changetrackingblob | Access Control (IAM)** pane, select **Add** and, then select **Add role assignment**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-change-workspace-configure-data-collection-rule/blob-add-role-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting to add role." lightbox="media/tutorial-change-workspace-configure-data-collection-rule/blob-add-role-expanded.png":::

1. On the **Add role assignment** pane, use the search for **Blob Data contributor** to assign a storage Blob contributor role for the specific VM. This permission provides access to read, write, and delete storage blob containers and data.

1. Select the role and assign it to your virtual machine.

#### [User Assigned Managed Identity](#tab/ua-mi)

For user-assigned managed identity, follow these steps to assign the user assigned managed identity to the VM and provide the permission.

1. On the **Storage accounts** pane, under **Data storage**, select **Containers** > **Changetracking blob** > **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. On **Changetrackingblob | Access Control (IAM)** pane, select **Add**, and then select **Add role assignment**.
1. Search for **Storage Blob Data Contributor**, select the role and assign it to your user-assigned managed identity.

1. Go to your virtual machine, under **Settings**, select **Identity**. Under the **User assigned** tab, select **+ Add**.

1. In the **Add user assigned managed identity**, select the **Subscription** and add the user-assigned managed identity.

#### Upgrade the extension version for Windows and Linux

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that ChangeTracking-Linux/ ChangeTracking-Windows extension version is upgraded to the current general release version: [GA Extension Version](../azure-change-tracking-inventory/extension-version-details.md)

Use the following command to upgrade the extension version:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm extension set -n {ExtensionName} --publisher Microsoft.Azure.ChangeTrackingAndInventory --ids {VirtualMachineResourceId} 
```
The extension for Windows is `Vms - ChangeTracking-Windows`and for Linux is `Vms - ChangeTracking-Linux`.

### Configure using wildcards
 
To configure the monitoring of files and folders using wildcards, consider the following: 

- Wildcards are required for tracking multiple files. 
- Wildcards can only be used in the last segment of a path, such as C:\folder\file or /etc/.conf* 
- If an environment variable includes a path that is not valid, validation will succeed but the path will fail when inventory runs. 
- When setting the path, avoid general paths such as c:.** which will result in too many folders being traversed. 

## Next steps
