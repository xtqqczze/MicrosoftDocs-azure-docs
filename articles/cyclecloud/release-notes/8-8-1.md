# Azure CycleCloud version 8.8.1

There are no features in this release. This update focuses on improving the stability and reliability of the application. We addressed several issues to ensure a smoother experience for all users.

## Resolved issues

- The `jetpack converge --rerun-scripts` argument didn't work. 
- The View-In-Portal link for Virtual Machine Scale Set instances directed users to the VM Resource page rather than the Virtual Machine Scale Set instance View. 
- Creating new Slurm clusters using older cyclecloud-slurm versions could fail if you didn't explicitly set `slurm.role` in the node configuration. 

## Breaking changes 

- The new Restart and Reimage actions are available only for nodes in node arrays (Virtual Machine Scale Set instances). Azure CycleCloud doesn't yet support restart or reimage operations for independent nodes. For independent nodes, use the Azure portal or CLI for restart or reimage operations. 
- Users may occasionally receive Entra authentication error messages in the UI when using Entra Authentication. These errors can be resolved by signing out and signing back in.
