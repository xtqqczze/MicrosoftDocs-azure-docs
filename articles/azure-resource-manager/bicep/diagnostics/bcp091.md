# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP091

This diagnostic occurs when Bicep cannot find a file at the specified path, most commonly a referenced module or type file

## Description

An error occurred reading file. Could not find a part of the path \<file-path>.

## Level

Error

## Solution

Correct the path or file name.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the files cannot be found at the specified paths.

```bicep
import { accessPolicies } from 'library/types.json'

module childLinked 'children/nestedChild.json' = {
  name: 'childLinked'
  params: {}
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by correcting the path and file name.
