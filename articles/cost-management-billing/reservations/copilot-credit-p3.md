# Optimize Copilot Credit costs with a pre-purchase plan

Save on your Copilot Credit costs when you buy a pre-purchase plan. Pre-purchase plans are commit units (CUs) bought at discounted tiers in your purchasing currency for a specific product. The more you buy, the greater the discount. Purchased CUs pay down qualifying costs in US dollars (USD). So, if Microsoft Copilot Studio generates a retail cost of $100 based on Copilot Credit usage, then 100 Copilot Credit CUs (CCCUs) are consumed.

Your Copilot Credit pre-purchase plan automatically uses your CCCUs to pay for eligible Copilot Credit usage during its one-year term or until Copilot Credit CUs run out. Your pre-purchase plan Copilot Credit CUs start paying for your Copilot usage without having to redeploy or reassign the plan. By default, plans are configured to renew at the end of the one-year term.

## Prerequisites

To buy a pre-purchase plan, you must have one of the following Azure subscriptions and roles:
- For an Azure subscription, the owner role or reservation purchaser role is required.
- For an Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscription, the [**Reserved Instances** policy option](../manage/direct-ea-administration.md#view-and-manage-enrollment-policies) must be enabled. To enable that policy option, you must be an EA administrator of the subscription.
- For a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) subscription, follow one of these articles:
   - [Buy Azure reservations on behalf of a customer](/partner-center/customers/azure-reservations-buying)
   - [Allow the customer to buy their own reservations](/partner-center/customers/give-customers-permission)

## Determine the right size to buy

To get started, estimate your expected Copilot Credit usage. This helps you determine the appropriate size for your pre-purchase plan. Each pre-purchase plan has a one-year term.

For example, suppose you expect to consume 1,500,000 Copilot Credit with custom agents created in Microsoft Copilot Studio. Assuming the pay-as-you-go rate for Copilot Credit to be $0.01, then at the pay-as-you-go rate, this will cost $15,000. By purchasing Tier 2 (15,000 CU) pre-purchase plan, let's say the cost of that tier is $14,100, it will give a 6% saving compared to the pay-as-you-go rate for the same usage.
