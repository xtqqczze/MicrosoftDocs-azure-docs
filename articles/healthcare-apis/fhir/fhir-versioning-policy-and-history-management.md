# Versioning policy and history management

The versioning policy in the Azure Health Data Services FHIR&reg; service is a configuration which determines how history is stored for every resource type, with the option for resource specific configuration. This policy is directly related to the concept of managing history for FHIR resources.

## History in FHIR

History in FHIR gives you the ability to see all previous versions of a resource. History in FHIR can be queried at the resource level, type level, or system level. The HL7 FHIR documentation has more information about the [history interaction](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history). History is useful when you want to see the evolution of a resource in FHIR, or if you want to see a resource's information at a specific point in time.

All past versions of a resource are considered obsolete, and the current version of a resource should be used for normal business workflow operations. However, it can be useful to see the state of a resource as a point in time when a past decision was made.

## Versioning policy

Versioning policy in the FHIR service lets you decide how history is stored, either at a FHIR service level or at a specific resource level. 

There are three different levels for versioning policy:

- `versioned`: History is stored for operation on resources. Resource version is incremented. This is the default.
- `version-update`: History is stored for operation on resources. Resource version is incremented. Updates require a valid `If-Match` header. For more information, see [VersionedUpdateExample.http](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/blob/main/docs/rest/VersionedUpdateExample.http).
- `no-version`: History isn't created for resources. Resource version is incremented.

Versioning policy is available to configure as a system-wide setting, and also to override at a resource level. The system-wide setting is used for all resources in your FHIR service, unless a specific resource level versioning policy has been added.

### Versioning policy comparison

| Policy Value     | History Behavior      | `meta.versionId` Update Behavior  | Default |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| `versioned`      | History is stored     | If-Match not required      | Yes     |
| `version-update` | History is stored     | If-Match required          | No      |
| `no-version`     | History isn't stored  | If-Match not required      | No      |

> [!NOTE]
> Changing the versioning policy to `no-version` has no effect on existing resource history. If history needs to be removed for resources, use the [$purge-history](purge-history.md) operation.

## Configuring versioning policy

To configure versioning policy, select **Versioning Policy Configuration** inside your FHIR service.

After you've browsed to Versioning Policy Configuration, you'll be able to configure the setting at both system level and the resource level (as an override of the system level). The system level configuration (annotated as 1) applies to every resource in your FHIR service unless a resource specific override (annotated as 2) has been configured.

When configuring resource level configuration, you're able to select the FHIR resource type (annotated as 1) and the specific versioning policy for this specific resource (annotated as 2). Make sure to select the **Add** button (annotated as 3) to queue up this setting for saving.

**Make sure** to select **Save** after you've completed your versioning policy configuration.

## History management

History in FHIR is important for end users to see how a resource has changed over time. It's also useful in coordination with audit logs to see the state of a resource before and after a user modified it. In general, it's recommended to keep history for a resource unless you know that the history isn't needed. Frequent resource updates can result in a large amount of data storage, which can be undesirable in FHIR services with a large amount of data.

Changing the versioning policy, either at a system level or resource level, won't remove the existing history for any resources in your FHIR service. If you're looking to reduce the history data size in your FHIR service, you must use the [$purge-history](purge-history.md) operation.

> [!NOTE] 
> The query parameter _summary=count and _count=0 can be added to _history endpoint to get a count of all versioned resources. This count includes soft deleted resources.

## Metadata-only updates and versioning
If the versioning policy is set to either `versioned` or `version-update`, metadata-only updates (changes to FHIR resources that only affect the metadata) increment the resource version, create a new version, and save the old version as a historical record. If you are making metadata-only changes using PUT updates, you can use the query parameter _meta-history for PUT updates to configure whether or not the old version is saved as a historical record.
- `_meta-history=true` is set by default. By default, the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, and the old version is saved as a historical record. The lastUpdated timestamp is updated to reflect the change.
- `_meta-history=false` The `_meta-history` parameter can be configured to `false`. This means that the resource version is incremented, a new version is created, but the old version is not saved as a historical record. The lastUpdated timestamp is also still updated to reflect the change. This configuration can be used to help reduce data storage when making metadata-only updates.  


### Example with `_meta-history=false` 
To demonstrate the use of the `_meta-history` parameter, follow this example:
1. Create a resource:  
`PUT <fhir server>/Patient/test-patient`
```
{
    "id": "test-patient",
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "name": [
        {
            "family": "Doe",
            "given": [ "John" ]
        }
    ]
}
```
2. Create a new version of the resource with `PUT <fhir server>/Patient/test-patient`. This will have version 2.
```
{
    "id": "test-patient",
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "name": [
        {
            "family": "Doe",
            "given": [ "Jane" ]
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Run: `GET <fhir server>/Patient/test-patient/_history`. Two versions should be returned, versions 1 and 2.
4. Use PUT to make a metadata-only update with `_meta-history=false` query parameter. Run: `PUT <fhir server>/Patient/test-patient?_meta-history=false`
``` 
{
    "id": "test-patient",
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "meta": {
        "tag": [
            {
                "system": "test",
                "code": "test"
            }
        ]
    },
    "name": [
        {
            "family": "Doe",
            "given": [ "Jane" ]
        }
    ]
}
```
5. This will increment resource version and create a new version 3, but the old version 2 will not be saved as a historical record. To see this, run: `GET <fhir server>/Patient/test-patient/_history`. Two versions should be returned, versions 1 and 3. Please note that `_meta-history=false` query parameter only affects metadata-only changes made using PUT. Using the query parameter to make metadata updates along with other non-metadata field value changes will increment the resource version and save the old version as a historical record.
