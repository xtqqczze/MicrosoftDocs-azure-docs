# Introduction to Azure security

Security is critical in today's cloud environment. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and protecting your data, applications, and infrastructure requires a comprehensive, multi-layered approach. We know that security is job one in the cloud and how important it is that you find accurate and timely information about Azure security.

This article provides a comprehensive look at the security available with Azure. For an end-to-end view of Azure security organized by protection, detection, and response capabilities, see [End-to-end security in Azure](end-to-end.md).

## Azure's defense-in-depth security approach

Azure employs a defense-in-depth strategy, providing multiple layers of security protection across the entire stack—from physical datacenters to compute, storage, networking, applications, and identity. This multi-layered approach ensures that if one layer is compromised, additional layers continue to protect your resources.

Azure's infrastructure is meticulously crafted from the ground up, encompassing everything from physical facilities to applications, to securely host millions of customers simultaneously. This robust foundation empowers businesses to confidently meet their security requirements. For information on how Microsoft secures the Azure platform itself, see [Azure infrastructure security](infrastructure.md). For details on physical datacenter security, see [Azure physical security](physical-security.md).

Azure is a public cloud service platform that supports a broad selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases, and devices. It can run Linux containers with Docker integration; build apps with JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Java, and Node.js; build back-ends for iOS, Android, and Windows devices. Azure public cloud services support the same technologies millions of developers and IT professionals already rely on and trust.

## Built-in platform security

Azure provides default security protections built into the platform that help protect your resources from the moment they're deployed. For comprehensive information on Azure's platform security capabilities, see [Azure platform security overview](platform.md).

- **Network Protection**: Azure DDoS Protection automatically shields your resources from distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **Encryption by Default**: Data encryption at rest is enabled by default for Azure Storage, SQL Database, and many other services
- **Identity Security**: Microsoft Entra ID provides secure authentication and authorization for all Azure services
- **Threat Detection**: Built-in threat detection monitors for suspicious activities across your Azure resources
- **Compliance**: Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry, helping you meet regulatory requirements

These foundational security controls work continuously in the background to protect your cloud infrastructure, with no additional configuration required for basic protection.

## Shared responsibility in the cloud

While Azure provides robust platform security, security in the cloud is a shared responsibility between Microsoft and our customers. The division of responsibilities depends on your deployment model (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS):

- **Microsoft's responsibility**: Azure secures the underlying infrastructure, including physical datacenters, hardware, network infrastructure, and the host operating system
- **Your responsibility**: You're responsible for securing your data, applications, identities, and access management

Every workload and application is different, with unique security requirements based on industry regulations, data sensitivity, and business needs. This is where Azure's advanced security services come into play. For more information about the shared responsibility model, see [Shared responsibility in the cloud](shared-responsibility.md).

> [!Note]
> The primary focus of this document is on customer-facing controls that you can use to customize and increase security for your applications and services.

## Advanced security services for every workload

To meet your unique security requirements, Azure provides a comprehensive suite of advanced security services that you can configure and customize for your specific needs. These services are organized across six functional areas: Operations, Applications, Storage, Networking, Compute, and Identity. For a comprehensive catalog of security services and technologies, see [Azure security services and technologies](services-technologies.md).

In addition, Azure provides you with a wide array of configurable security options and the ability to control them so that you can customize security to meet the unique requirements of your organization's deployments. This document helps you understand how Azure security capabilities can help you fulfill these requirements.

For a structured view of Azure security controls and baselines, see the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction), which provides comprehensive security guidance for Azure services. For information on Azure's technical security capabilities, see [Azure security technical capabilities](technical-capabilities.md).

### Compute security

Securing your virtual machines and compute resources is fundamental to protecting your workloads in Azure. Azure provides multiple layers of compute security, from hardware-based protections to software-based threat detection. For detailed virtual machine security information, see [Azure Virtual Machines security overview](virtual-machines-overview.md).

#### Trusted launch

[Trusted launch](/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch) is the default for newly created Generation 2 Azure VMs and Virtual Machine Scale Sets. Trusted launch protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques including boot kits, rootkits, and kernel-level malware.

Trusted launch provides:

* **Secure Boot**: Protects against installation of malware-based rootkits and boot kits by ensuring only signed operating systems and drivers can boot
* **vTPM (virtual Trusted Platform Module)**: A dedicated secure vault for keys and measurements that enables attestation and boot integrity verification
* **Boot Integrity Monitoring**: Uses attestation through Microsoft Defender for Cloud to verify boot chain integrity and alert on failures

Trusted launch can be enabled on existing VMs and Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

#### Azure confidential computing

[Azure confidential computing](/azure/confidential-computing/overview-azure-products) provides the final, missing piece, of the data protection puzzle. It allows you to keep your data encrypted always. While at rest, when in motion through the network, and now, even while loaded in memory and in use. Additionally, by making [Remote Attestation](/azure/attestation/overview) possible, it allows you to cryptographically verify that the VM you deploy booted securely and is configured correctly, before unlocking your data.

The spectrum of options ranges from enabling "lift and shift" scenarios of existing applications, to full control of security features. For Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), you can use:

- **[Confidential virtual machines powered by AMD SEV-SNP](/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview)**: Hardware-based memory encryption with up to 256 GB encrypted memory
- **[Confidential VMs with Intel TDX](/azure/confidential-computing/tdx-confidential-vm-overview)**: Intel Trust Domain Extensions providing enhanced performance and security
- **[Confidential VMs with NVIDIA H100 GPUs](/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview)**: GPU-accelerated confidential computing for AI/ML workloads
- **[Confidential application enclaves with Intel SGX](/azure/confidential-computing/application-development)**: Application-level isolation for sensitive code and data

For Platform as a Service (PaaS), Azure offers multiple [container-based confidential computing options](/azure/confidential-computing/choose-confidential-containers-offerings), including integrations with [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/confidential-computing/confidential-nodes-aks-overview).

#### Antimalware & Antivirus

With Azure IaaS, you can use antimalware software from security vendors such as Microsoft, Symantec, Trend Micro, McAfee, and Kaspersky to protect your virtual machines from malicious files, adware, and other threats. [Microsoft Antimalware](antimalware.md) for Azure Virtual Machines is a protection capability that helps identify and remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. Microsoft Antimalware provides configurable alerts when known malicious or unwanted software attempts to install itself or run on your Azure systems. Microsoft Antimalware can also be deployed using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> For modern protection, consider [Microsoft Defender for Servers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/plan-defender-for-servers) which provides advanced threat protection including endpoint detection and response (EDR) through integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

#### Hardware Security Module

Encryption and authentication don't improve security unless the keys themselves are protected. You can simplify the management and security of your critical secrets and keys by storing them in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview). Key Vault provides the option to store your keys in hardware Security modules (HSMs) certified to [FIPS 140-3 Level 3](/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys#compliance) standards. Your SQL Server encryption keys for backup or [transparent data encryption](/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption) can all be stored in Key Vault with any keys or secrets from your applications. Permissions and access to these protected items are managed through [Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/).

For comprehensive information on key management options including Azure Key Vault, Managed HSM, and Payment HSM, see [Key management in Azure](key-management.md).

#### Virtual machine backup

[Azure Backup](/azure/backup/backup-overview) is a solution that protects your application data with zero capital investment and minimal operating costs. Application errors can corrupt your data, and human errors can introduce bugs into your applications that can lead to security issues. With Azure Backup, your virtual machines running Windows and Linux are protected.

#### Azure Site Recovery

An important part of your organization's [business continuity/disaster recovery (BCDR)](/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure) strategy is figuring out how to keep corporate workloads and apps up and running when planned and unplanned outages occur. [Azure Site Recovery](/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview) helps orchestrate replication, failover, and recovery of workloads and apps so that they're available from a secondary location if your primary location goes down.

#### SQL VM TDE

Transparent data encryption (TDE) and column level encryption (CLE) are SQL server encryption features. This form of encryption requires customers to manage and store the cryptographic keys you use for encryption.

The Azure Key Vault (AKV) service is designed to improve the security and management of these keys in a secure and highly available location. The SQL Server Connector enables SQL Server to use these keys from Azure Key Vault.

If you're running SQL Server with on-premises machines, there are steps you can follow to access Azure Key Vault from your on-premises SQL Server instance. But for SQL Server in Azure VMs, you can save time by using the Azure Key Vault Integration feature. With a few Azure PowerShell cmdlets to enable this feature, you can automate the configuration necessary for a SQL VM to access your key vault.

For a comprehensive list of database security best practices, see [Azure database security checklist](database-security-checklist.md).

#### VM Disk Encryption

[!INCLUDE [Azure Disk Encryption retirement notice](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/security/azure-disk-encryption-retirement.md)]

For modern virtual machine encryption, Azure offers:

- **Encryption at host**: Provides end-to-end encryption for VM data, including temp disks and OS/data disk caches
- **Confidential disk encryption**: Available with confidential VMs for hardware-based encryption
- **Server-side encryption with customer-managed keys**: Manage your own encryption keys through Azure Key Vault

For more information, see [Overview of managed disk encryption options](/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview).

#### Virtual networking

Virtual machines need network connectivity. To support that requirement, Azure requires virtual machines to be connected to an Azure Virtual Network. An Azure Virtual Network is a logical construct built on top of the physical Azure network fabric. Each logical [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) is isolated from all other Azure Virtual Networks. This isolation helps ensure that network traffic in your deployments isn't accessible to other Microsoft Azure customers.

#### Patch Updates

Patch Updates provide the basis for finding and fixing potential problems and simplify the software update management process, both by reducing the number of software updates you must deploy in your enterprise and by increasing your ability to monitor compliance.

#### Security policy management and reporting

[Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats, and provides you increased visibility into, and control over, the security of your Azure resources. It provides integrated Security monitoring and policy management across your Azure subscriptions, helps detect threats that might otherwise go unnoticed, and works with a broad ecosystem of security solutions.

### Application security

Application security focuses on protecting your applications from threats throughout their lifecycle—from development to deployment and runtime. Azure provides comprehensive tools for secure development, testing, and protection of applications. For secure application development guidance, see [Develop secure applications on Azure](/azure/security/develop/secure-develop). For PaaS-specific security best practices, see [Securing PaaS deployments](paas-deployments.md). For IaaS deployment security, see [Security best practices for IaaS workloads in Azure](iaas.md).

#### Penetration Testing

We don't perform [penetration testing](pen-testing.md) of your application for you, but we do understand that you want and need to perform testing on your own applications. Notification of Microsoft of pen testing activities is no longer required customers must still comply with the [Microsoft Cloud Penetration Testing Rules of Engagement](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement).

#### Web Application firewall

The Web Application Firewall (WAF) in [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview) provides protection for web applications against common web-based attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. It is preconfigured to defend against the top 10 vulnerabilities identified by the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

#### Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service

[App Service Authentication / Authorization](/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) is a feature that provides a way for your application to sign in users so that you don't have to change code on the app backend. It provides an easy way to protect your application and work with per-user data.

#### Layered Security Architecture

Since [App Service Environments](/azure/app-service/environment/app-service-app-service-environment-intro) provide an isolated runtime environment deployed into an [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), developers can create a layered security architecture providing differing levels of network access for each application tier. It's common to hide API back-ends from general Internet access, and only permit APIs to be called by upstream web apps. [Network Security groups (NSGs)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm) can be used on Azure Virtual Network subnets containing App Service Environments to restrict public access to API applications.

[App Service web apps](/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs) offer robust diagnostic capabilities for capturing logs from both the web server and the web application. These diagnostics are categorized into web server diagnostics and application diagnostics. Web server diagnostics include significant advancements for diagnosing and troubleshooting sites and applications.

The first new feature is real-time state information about application pools, worker processes, sites, application domains, and running requests. The second new advantages are the detailed trace events that track a request throughout the complete request-and-response process.

To enable the collection of these trace events, IIS 7 can be configured to automatically capture comprehensive trace logs in XML format for specific requests. The collection can be based on elapsed time or error response codes.

### Storage security

Storage security is essential for protecting your data at rest and in transit. Azure provides multiple layers of encryption, access controls, and monitoring capabilities to ensure your data remains secure. For detailed information on data encryption, see [Azure encryption overview](encryption-overview.md). For key management options, see [Key management in Azure](key-management.md). For data encryption best practices, see [Azure data security and encryption best practices](data-encryption-best-practices.md).

#### Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)
You can secure your storage account with [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md). Restricting access based on the [need to know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know) and [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) security principles is imperative for organizations that want to enforce Security policies for data access. These access rights are granted by assigning the appropriate Azure role to groups and applications at a certain scope. You can use [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md), such as Storage Account Contributor, to assign privileges to users. Access to the storage keys for a storage account using the [Azure Resource Manager](../../storage/blobs/security-recommendations.md#data-protection) model can be controlled through Azure RBAC.

#### Shared Access Signature
A [shared access signature (SAS)](../../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md) provides delegated access to resources in your storage account. The SAS means that you can grant a client limited permissions to objects in your storage account for a specified period and with a specified set of permissions. You can grant these limited permissions without having to share your account access keys.

#### Encryption in Transit
Encryption in transit is a mechanism of protecting data when it's transmitted across networks. With Azure Storage, you can secure data using:

- [Transport-level encryption](../../storage/blobs/security-recommendations.md), such as HTTPS when you transfer data into or out of Azure Storage.

- [Wire encryption](../../storage/blobs/security-recommendations.md), such as [SMB 3.0 encryption](../../storage/blobs/security-recommendations.md) for [Azure File shares](../../storage/files/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-files.md).

- Client-side encryption, to encrypt the data before it's transferred into storage and to decrypt the data after it's transferred out of storage.

#### Encryption at rest
For many organizations, data encryption at rest is a mandatory step towards data privacy, compliance, and data sovereignty. There are three Azure storage security features that provide encryption of data that is at rest:

- [Storage Service Encryption](../../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md) allows you to request that the storage service automatically encrypt data when writing it to Azure Storage.

- [Client-side Encryption](../../storage/common/storage-client-side-encryption.md) also provides the feature of encryption at rest.

- [Azure Disk Encryption for Linux VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview) and [Azure Disk Encryption for Windows VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview) allows you to encrypt the OS disks and data disks used by an IaaS virtual machine.

#### Storage Analytics

[Azure Storage Analytics](/rest/api/storageservices/fileservices/storage-analytics) performs logging and provides metrics data for a storage account. You can use this data to trace requests, analyze usage trends, and diagnose issues with your storage account. Storage Analytics logs detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis. The following types of authenticated requests are logged:

- Successful requests.
- Failed requests, including timeout, throttling, network, authorization, and other errors.
- Requests using a Shared Access Signature (SAS), including failed and successful requests.
- Requests to analytics data.

#### Enabling Browser-Based Clients Using CORS

[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/rest/api/storageservices/fileservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services) is a mechanism that allows domains to give each other permission for accessing each other's resources. The User Agent sends extra headers to ensure that the JavaScript code loaded from a certain domain is allowed to access resources located at another domain. The latter domain then replies with extra headers allowing or denying the original domain access to its resources.

Azure storage services now support CORS so that once you set the CORS rules for the service, a properly authenticated request made against the service from a different domain is evaluated to determine whether it's allowed according to the rules you have specified.

### Network security

Network security controls how traffic flows to and from your Azure resources. Azure provides a comprehensive set of network security services, from basic firewalling to advanced threat protection and global load balancing. For comprehensive network security information, see [Azure network security overview](network-overview.md). For network security best practices, see [Azure network security best practices](network-best-practices.md).

#### Network Layer Controls

Network access control is the act of limiting connectivity to and from specific devices or subnets and represents the core of network security. The goal of network access control is to make sure that your virtual machines and services are accessible to only users and devices to which you want them accessible.

##### Network Security Groups

A [Network Security Group (NSG)](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) is a basic stateful packet filtering firewall and it enables you to control access based on a five-tuple. NSGs don't provide application layer inspection or authenticated access controls. They can be used to control traffic moving between subnets within an Azure Virtual Network and traffic between an Azure Virtual Network and the Internet.

##### Azure Firewall

[Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic inspection.

Azure Firewall is offered in three SKUs: Basic, Standard, and Premium:

- **[Azure Firewall Basic](/azure/firewall/basic-features)** - Designed for small and medium-sized businesses, offering essential protection at an affordable price point
- **[Azure Firewall Standard](/azure/firewall/features)** - Provides L3-L7 filtering, threat intelligence feeds from Microsoft Cyber Security, and can scale to 30 Gbps
- **[Azure Firewall Premium](/azure/firewall/premium-features)** - Advanced threat protection for highly sensitive and regulated environments with:
  - **TLS Inspection**: Decrypts outbound traffic, processes it for threats, then re-encrypts before sending to destination
  - **IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System)**: Signature-based IDPS with over 67,000 signatures in more than 50 categories, updated with 20-40+ new rules daily
  - **URL Filtering**: Extends FQDN filtering to consider the entire URL path
  - **Advanced Web Categories**: Enhanced categorization based on complete URLs for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  - **Enhanced Performance**: Scales up to 100 Gbps with 10 Gbps fat flow support
  - **PCI DSS Compliance**: Meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requirements

Azure Firewall Premium is essential for protecting against ransomware, as it can detect and block Command and Control (C&C) connectivity used by ransomware to fetch encryption keys. Learn more about [ransomware protection with Azure Firewall](ransomware-protection-with-azure-firewall.md).

##### Azure DDoS Protection

[Azure DDoS Protection](/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview), combined with application design best practices, offers enhanced features to defend against DDoS attacks. It is automatically tuned to protect your specific Azure resources in a virtual network. Enabling protection is simple on any new or existing virtual network and requires no changes to your applications or resources.

Azure DDoS Protection offers two tiers: DDoS Network Protection and DDoS IP Protection.

* **DDoS Network Protection** - Provides enhanced features to defend against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It operates at network layers 3 and 4 and includes advanced features such as DDoS rapid response support, cost protection, and discounts on Web Application Firewall (WAF).

* **DDoS IP Protection** - Follows a pay-per-protected IP model. It includes the same core engineering features as DDoS Network Protection but does not offer the additional services like DDoS rapid response support, cost protection, and WAF discounts. 

##### Route Control and Forced Tunneling

The ability to control routing behavior on your Azure Virtual Networks is a critical network security and access control capability. For example, if you want to make sure that all traffic to and from your Azure Virtual Network goes through that virtual security appliance, you need to be able to control and customize routing behavior. You can do this by configuring User-Defined Routes in Azure.

[User-Defined Routes](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#custom-routes) allow you to customize inbound and outbound paths for traffic moving into and out of individual virtual machines or subnets to ensure the most secure route possible. [Forced tunneling](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm) is a mechanism you can use to ensure that your services aren't allowed to initiate a connection to devices on the Internet.

This is different from being able to accept incoming connections and then responding to them. Front-end web servers need to respond to requests from Internet hosts, and so Internet-sourced traffic is allowed inbound to these web servers and the web servers can respond.

Forced tunneling is commonly used to force outbound traffic to the Internet to go through on-premises security proxies and firewalls.

##### Virtual Network Security Appliances

While Network Security Groups, User-Defined Routes, and forced tunneling provide you with a level of security at the network and transport layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), there might be times when you want to enable security at higher levels of the stack. You can access these enhanced network security features by using an Azure partner network security appliance solution. You can find the most current Azure partner network security solutions by visiting the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/) and searching for **security** and **network security**.

#### Azure Virtual Network

An Azure virtual network (VNet) is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It's a logical isolation of the Azure network fabric dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies, and route tables within this network. You can segment your VNet into subnets and place Azure IaaS virtual machines (VMs) on Azure Virtual Networks.

Additionally, you can connect the virtual network to your on-premises network using one of the [connectivity options](/azure/vpn-gateway/) available in Azure. In essence, you can expand your network to Azure, with complete control on IP address blocks with the benefit of enterprise scale Azure provides.

Azure networking supports various secure remote access scenarios. Some of these include:

- [Connect individual workstations to an Azure Virtual Network](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-rm-ps)

- [Connect on-premises network to an Azure Virtual Network with a VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal)

- [Connect on-premises network to an Azure Virtual Network with a dedicated WAN link](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction)

- [Connect Azure Virtual Networks to each other](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps)

#### Azure Virtual Network Manager

[Azure Virtual Network Manager](/azure/virtual-network-manager/overview) provides a centralized solution for managing and securing your virtual networks at scale. It uses [security admin rules](/azure/virtual-network-manager/concept-security-admins) to centrally define and enforce security policies across your entire organization. Security admin rules take precedence over network security group (NSGs) rules and are applied on the virtual network. This allows organizations to enforce core policies with security admin rules, while still enabling downstream teams to tailor NSGs according to their specific needs at the subnet and NIC levels.

Depending on the needs of your organization you can use **Allow**, **Deny**, or **Always Allow** rule actions to enforce security policies:

| Rule Action | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Allow**       | Allows the specified traffic by default. Downstream NSGs still receive this traffic and might deny it.|
| **Always Allow** | Always allow the specified traffic, regardless of other rules with lower priority or NSGs. This can be used to ensure that monitoring agent, domain controller, or management traffic isn't blocked. |
| **Deny**          | Block the specified traffic. Downstream NSGs won't evaluate this traffic after being denied by a security admin rule, ensuring your high-risk ports for existing and new virtual networks are protected by default. |

In Azure Virtual Network Manager, [network groups](/azure/virtual-network-manager/concept-network-groups) allow you to group virtual networks together for centralized management and enforcement of security policies. Network groups are a logical grouping of virtual networks based on your needs from a topology and security perspective. You can manually update the virtual network membership of your network groups or you can [define conditional statements with Azure Policy](/azure/virtual-network-manager/concept-azure-policy-integration) to dynamically update network groups to automatically update your network group membership.

#### Azure Private Link

[Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link/) enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services privately in your virtual network over a [private endpoint](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview). Setup and consumption using Azure Private Link is consistent across Azure PaaS, customer-owned, and shared partner services. Traffic from your virtual network to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

[Private Endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Azure Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet to connect you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. Exposing your virtual network to the public internet is no longer necessary to consume services on Azure. 

You can also create your own private link service in your virtual network. [Azure Private Link service](/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) is the reference to your own service that is powered by Azure Private Link. Your service that is running behind Azure Standard Load Balancer can be enabled for Private Link access so that consumers to your service can access it privately from their own virtual networks. Your customers can create a private endpoint inside their virtual network and map it to this service. Exposing your service to the public internet is no longer necessary to render services on Azure. 

#### VPN Gateway

To send network traffic between your Azure Virtual Network and your on-premises site, you must create a VPN gateway for your Azure Virtual Network. A [VPN gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) is a type of virtual network gateway that sends encrypted traffic across a public connection. You can also use VPN gateways to send traffic between Azure Virtual Networks over the Azure network fabric.

#### Express Route

Microsoft Azure [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) is a dedicated WAN link that lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a dedicated private connection facilitated by a connectivity provider.

![Express Route](./media/overview/azure-security-figure-1.png)

With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility.

ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet and thus can be considered more secure than VPN-based solutions. This allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections over the Internet.

#### Application Gateway

Microsoft [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview) provides an [Application Delivery Controller (ADC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_delivery_controller) as a service, offering various layer 7 load balancing capabilities for your application.

![Application Gateway](./media/overview/azure-security-figure-2.png)

It allows you to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU intensive TLS termination to the Application Gateway (also known as **TLS offload** or **TLS bridging**). It also provides other Layer 7 routing capabilities including round-robin distribution of incoming traffic, cookie-based session affinity, URL path-based routing, and the ability to host multiple websites behind a single Application Gateway. Azure Application Gateway is a layer-7 load balancer.

It provides failover, performance-routing HTTP requests between different servers, whether they are on the cloud or on-premises.

Application provides many Application Delivery Controller (ADC) features including HTTP load balancing, cookie-based session affinity, [TLS offload](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/tutorial-restrict-web-traffic-powershell), custom health probes, support for multi-site, and many others.

#### Web Application Firewall

Web Application Firewall is a feature of [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview) that provides protection to web applications that use application gateway for standard Application Delivery Control (ADC) functions. Web application firewall does this by protecting them against most of the OWASP top 10 common web vulnerabilities.

![Web Application Firewall](./media/overview/azure-security-figure-3.png)

- SQL injection protection

- Protection against common web attacks such as command injection, HTTP request smuggling, HTTP response splitting, and remote file inclusion

- Protection against HTTP protocol violations

- Protection against HTTP protocol anomalies, such as missing host, user-agent, and accept headers

- Prevention against bots, crawlers, and scanners

- Detection of common application misconfigurations (e.g., Apache, IIS)

A centralized web application firewall (WAF) simplifies security management and enhances protection against web attacks. It provides better assurance against intrusion threats and can respond faster to security threats by patching known vulnerabilities centrally, rather than securing each individual web application. Existing application gateways can be easily upgraded to include a web application firewall.

#### Azure Front Door

[Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) is a global, scalable entry point that uses Microsoft's global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications. Front Door provides:

- **Global load balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple backends in different regions
- **Integrated Web Application Firewall**: Protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks
- **DDoS protection**: Built-in protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **SSL/TLS offload**: Centralized certificate management and traffic encryption
- **URL-based routing**: Route traffic to different backends based on URL patterns

Front Door combines content delivery, application acceleration, and security into a single service.

#### Traffic Manager

[Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) allows you to control the distribution of user traffic for service endpoints in different datacenters. Service endpoints supported by Traffic Manager include Azure VMs, Web Apps, and Cloud services. You can also use Traffic Manager with external, non-Azure endpoints.

Traffic Manager uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to direct client requests to the most appropriate endpoint based on a [traffic-routing method](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods) and the health of the endpoints. Traffic Manager provides a range of traffic-routing methods to suit different application needs, endpoint health [monitoring](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-monitoring), and automatic failover. Traffic Manager is resilient to failure, including the failure of an entire Azure region.

#### Azure Load Balancer

[Azure Load Balancer](/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) delivers high availability and network performance to your applications. It's a Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that distributes incoming traffic among healthy instances of services defined in a load-balanced set. Azure Load Balancer can be configured to:

- Load balance incoming Internet traffic to virtual machines. This configuration is known as [public load balancing](/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations).

- Load balance traffic between virtual machines in a virtual network, between virtual machines in cloud services, or between on-premises computers and virtual machines in a cross-premises virtual network. This configuration is known as [internal load balancing](/azure/load-balancer/components#frontend-ip-configurations).

- Forward external traffic to a specific virtual machine

#### Internal DNS

You can manage the list of DNS servers used in a VNet in the Management Portal, or in the network configuration file. Customer can add up to 12 DNS servers for each VNet. When specifying DNS servers, it's important to verify that you list customer’s DNS servers in the correct order for customer’s environment. DNS server lists don't work round-robin. They're used in the order that they're specified. If the first DNS server on the list is able to be reached, the client uses that DNS server regardless of whether the DNS server is functioning properly or not. To change the DNS server order for customer’s virtual network, remove the DNS servers from the list and add them back in the order that customer wants. DNS supports the availability aspect of the “CIA” security triad.

#### Azure DNS
