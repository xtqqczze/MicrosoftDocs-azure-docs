> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data connector agent for SAP is being **deprecated** and will be permanently disabled by **September 30th 2026**. We recommend that you [migrate to the agentless data connector](../sap/sap-agent-migrate.md). Learn more about the agentless approach from our [blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsentinelblog/microsoft-sentinel-for-sap-agentless-connector-ga/4464490).
