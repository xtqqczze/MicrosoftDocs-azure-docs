# Migrate to Microsoft Sentinel with the SIEM migration experience

The SIEM migration tool analyzes Splunk detections, including custom detections, and recommends best‑fit Microsoft Sentinel detections rules. It also provides recommendations for data connectors, both Microsoft and third-party connectors available in Content Hub to enable the recommend detections. Customers can track the migration by assigning the right status to each recommendation card.

> [!NOTE]
> The old migration tool is deprecated. This article describes the current SIEM migration experience.

The SIEM Migration experience includes the following features:

- The experience focuses on migrating Splunk security monitoring to Microsoft Sentinel and mapping out-of-the-box (OOTB) analytics rules wherever possible.
- The experience supports migration of Splunk detections to Microsoft Sentinel analytics rules.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Sentinel in Microsoft Defender portal
- At least Microsoft Sentinel Contributor permissions in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace
- <a href="/copilot/security/get-started-security-copilot" target="_blank">Security Copilot</a> enabled in your tenant with at least a [workspace operator role](/copilot/security/authentication#assign-security-copilot-access) assigned

> [!NOTE]
> Though you need [Security Copilot](https://securitycopilot.microsoft.com/) enabled in your tenant, it doesn't consume any SCUs so it doesn't incur additional costs. To ensure you don't incur any unintentional costs after you set it up, go to **Manage workspace** > **Usage monitoring**, set SCUs to zero, and make sure use overage units is disabled.

## Export detection rules from your current SIEM

In the **Search and Reporting** app in Splunk, run the following query:

```kusto
| rest splunk_server=local count=0 /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches | search disabled=0 | search alert_threshold != "" | table title, search, description, cron_schedule, dispatch.earliest_time, alert.severity, alert_comparator, alert_threshold, alert.suppress.period, id, eai:acl.app, actions, action.correlationsearch.annotations, action.correlationsearch.enabled | tojson | table _raw | rename _raw as alertrules | mvcombine delim=", " alertrules | append [ | rest splunk_server=local count=0 /servicesNS/-/-/admin/macros | table title,definition,args,iseval | tojson | table _raw | rename _raw as macros | mvcombine delim=", " macros ] | filldown alertrules |tail 1 
```

You need a Splunk admin role to export all Splunk alerts. For more information, see [Splunk role-based user access](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.1.3/Security/Aboutusersandroles).

<!---
QRadar

Export your QRadar rule data as a CSV file, as explained here Exporting rules - IBM Documentation. Two notes regarding the export: 

1. The default export includes the alert rules, but not the building blocks which can carry important information. Clear any filter values for the “Rule or Building Block(BB)” to allow both the rules and the BBs to be exported. 

1. Only include the following fields in your export to avoid duplications which can lead to QRadar application freeze: 

"Rule name", "Type", "Rule enabled", "Notes", "Action details", "Response details", "Rule response: Event description", "Is rule", "Rule installed", "Rule response: Event name", "Rule: test definition", "Content extension name", "Content category" 
--->

## Start the SIEM migration experience

After exporting the rules, do the following:

1. Go to `security.microsoft.com`.

1. From the **SOC Optimization** tab, select **Set up your new SIEM**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/set-up-new-siem.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Setup your new SIEM option in the top right corner of the SOC Optimization screen.":::

1. Select **Migrate from Splunk**:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/migrate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Migrate from current SIEM option.":::

1. Upload the configuration data that [you exported from your current SIEM](#export-detection-rules-from-your-current-siem) and select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/upload-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Upload file button to upload the exported configuration data.":::

    The migration tool analyzes the export and identifies the number of data sources and detection rules in the file you provided. Use this information to confirm that you have the right export.

    If the data doesn't look correct, select **Replace file** from the top right corner and upload a new export. When the correct file is uploaded, select **Next**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/confirm-siem.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation screen showing the number of data sources and detection rules.":::

1. Select a workspace, then select **Start Analyzing**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/select-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the UI asking the user to select a workspace.":::

    The migration tool maps the detection rules to Microsoft Sentinel data sources and detection rules. If there are no recommendations in the workspace, recommendations are created. If there are existing recommendations, the tool deletes and replaces them with new ones.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/getting-ready.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the migration tool getting ready to analyze the rules.":::

1. Refresh the page and select the **SIEM setup analysis status** to view the progress of the analysis:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/setup-analysis-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the SIEM Set-up analysis status showing the progress of the analysis.":::

    This page doesn't refresh automatically. To see the latest status, close and reopen the page.

   The analysis is complete when all three check marks are green. If the three checkmarks are green but there are no recommendations, it means that no matches were found for your rules.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/status-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing all three check marks green indicating analysis is complete.":::

    When the analysis completes, the migration tool generates use-case-based recommendations, grouped by Content Hub solutions. You can also download a detailed report of the analysis. The report contains a detailed analysis of recommended migration jobs, including Splunk rules that we didn't find good solution for, weren't detected, or not applicable.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/recommendations.png" alt-text="A screenshot of recommendations generated by the migration tool." lightbox="./media/siem-migration/recommendations.png":::

    Filter *recommendation type* by *SIEM Setup* to see migration recommendations.

1. Select one of the recommendation cards to view the data sources and rules mapped.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/recommendation-card.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a recommendation card." lightbox="./media/siem-migration/recommendation-card.png":::

    The tool matches the Splunk rules to out-of-box Microsoft Sentinel data connectors and out-of-box Microsoft Sentinel detection rules.
    The *connectors* tab shows the data connectors matched to the rules from your SIEM and the status (connected or not disconnected). If you want to use a connector that's not connected, you can connect from the connector tab. If a connector isn't installed, go to the Content hub and install the solution that contains the connector you want to use.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/connectors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel data connectors matched to Splunk or QRadar rules.":::

    The *detections* tab shows the following information:

    - Recommendations from the SIEM migration tool.
    - The current Splunk detection rule from your uploaded file.
    - The status of the detection rule in Microsoft Sentinel. The status can be:
        - *Enabled*: The detection rule is created from the rule template, enabled, and active (from a previous action)
        - *Disabled*: The detection rule is installed from the Content Hub but not enabled in the Microsoft Sentinel workspace
        - *Not in use*: The detection rule was installed from Content Hub and is available as a template to be enabled
        - *Not installed*: The detection rule wasn't installed from the Content Hub
    - The required connectors that need to be configured to bring the logs required for the recommended detection rule. If a required connector isn't available, there's a side panel with a wizard to install it from the Content Hub. If all required connectors are connected, a green check mark appears.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/detection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Sentinel detection rules matched to Splunk or QRadar rules." lightbox="./media/siem-migration/detection.png":::

## Enable detection rules

When you select a rule, the rules details side panel opens and you can view the rules template details.

:::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/rule-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the rule details side panel.":::

- If the associated data connector is installed and configured, select **Enable detection** to enable the detection rule.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/enable-detection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enable detection button in the rule details side panel." lightbox="./media/siem-migration/enable-detection.png":::

- Select **More actions** > **Create manually** to open the analytics rules wizard so you can review and edit the rule before enabling it.
- If the rule is already enabled, select **Edit** to open the analytics rules wizard to review and edit the rule.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/more-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the More actions button in the rules wizard.":::

    The wizard shows the Splunk SPL rule and you can compare it with the Microsoft Sentinel KQL.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/compare-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the comparison between Splunk SPL rule and Microsoft Sentinel KQL.":::

> [!TIP]
> Instead of creating rules manually from scratch, it can be faster and simpler to enable the rule from the template and then edit it as needed.

If the data connector isn't installed and configured to stream logs, *Enable detection* is disabled.

- You can enable several rules at once by selecting the check boxes next to each rule you want to enable and then selecting **Enable selected detections** at the top of the page.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/siem-migration/enable-multiple-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of rules in the detection tab with checkboxes next to them." lightbox="./media/siem-migration/enable-multiple-rules.png":::

The SIEM migration tool doesn't explicitly install any connectors or enable detection rules.

## Limitations

- The migration tool maps the rules export to out-of-the-box Microsoft Sentinel data connectors and detection rules.
