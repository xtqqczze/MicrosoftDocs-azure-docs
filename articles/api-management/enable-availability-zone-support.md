# Enable availability zone support on Azure API Management instances

[!INCLUDE [premium-premiumv2](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-premium-v2.md)]

This article describes how to enable and configure availability zones on an Azure API Management instance.

For more detailed information about reliability features of API Management, such as availability zones and multiregion deployments, see [Reliability in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).


## Availability zone support

While instances in both the Premium and Premium v2 tiers benefit from availability zone support, the implementation differs between the two tiers.

| Premium | Premium v2 |
|---------|------------|
| - Automatically enable zone redundancy when you create a new instance or add a new location to an existing instance in a supported region.<br/><br/>- Zonal or zone-redundant settings can also be manually configured in a new or existing instance. | - Optionally enable zone redundancy when creating an instance in a supported region.<br/><br/>- Configuring zone redundancy in an existing instance isn't supported. |

#### [Premium](#tab/prem)

When you create a new API Management instance in the **Premium** tier in a region that supports availability zones, or you [deploy API Management to multiple regions](api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md), API Management provides two types of availability zone support:

- **Automatic:** API Management provides automatic availability zone support when you don't specify which availability zones to use.

- **Manual:** API Management provides manual availability zone support when you explicitly specify which availability zones to use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure the reliability of your API Management instance, use the automatic availability zone support. To achieve maximum zone redundancy, deploy a minimum of two units in each region where you deploy API Management to ensure that an availability zone outage doesn't affect your instance. For more information, see [Reliability in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).

### Manual availability zone support

We recommend automatic availability zone configuration in the Premium tier, but you can manually configure or update availability zones for an existing location of your API Management instance. The following sections provide steps for manually configuring zone redundancy on an existing location of your API Management instance, depending on whether the instance is injected in a virtual network.

> [!NOTE]
> You can optionally enable a *zonal* configuration, where the API Management instance or location is deployed in a single availability zone. Because it doesn't provide resiliency to an outage in that zone, this configuration generally isn't recommended except for specific scenarios. For more information, see [Reliability in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> If you manually configure availability zones on an API Management instance that's configured with autoscaling, you might need to adjust your autoscale settings after configuration. In this case, the number of API Management units in autoscale rules and limits must be a multiple of the number of zones. If you use the automatic availability zone support, you don't need to adjust your autoscale settings. 

#### [Premium v2](#tab/premv2)

In the **Premium v2** tier, you can enable availability zone support only when you create a new API Management instance in a supported region. Enabling zone redundancy is optional. In this service tier, you don't have the option to view or modify availability zone settings on an existing instance.

---

## Prerequisites

#### [Premium](#tab/prem)

* Your instance must be in one of the [Azure regions that support availability zones](../reliability/regions-list.md).

* If you don't have an API Management instance, create one by following the [create a new API Management instance by using the Azure portal](../api-management/get-started-create-service-instance.md) quickstart. Select the **Premium** service tier.

* If you have an existing API Management instance, make sure that it's in the **Premium** (classic) tier. If it isn't, [upgrade to the Premium tier](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md#change-your-api-management-service-tier).

#### [Premium v2](#tab/premv2)

* Choose an Azure region that supports both [Premium v2 instances](api-management-region-availability.md) and [availability zones](../reliability/regions-list.md).

## Configure availability zones

Follow these steps to enable availability zone support on your API Management instance.

#### [Premium](#tab/prem)

### Enable availability zones when creating an instance

In the **Premium** tier, availability zone support is automatically enabled when you create a new API Management instance in a supported region. You can optionally specify which availability zones to use.

### Existing instance not injected in a virtual network

To manually configure availability zone support on an existing location of an API Management instance, follow these steps:

1. Thoroughly understand all [requirements and considerations for availability zones in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).

1. In the Azure portal, go to your API Management instance.

1. On the **Deployment + infrastructure** menu, select **Locations**.

1. Select the location that you want to enable. The location must support availability zones, as mentioned earlier in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Under **Units**, select the number of scale [units](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md) that you want in the location.

1. Under **Availability zones**, leave the **Automatic** setting (recommended), or optionally select one or more zones. If you select specific zones, the number of units that you select must distribute evenly across the availability zones. For example, if you select three units, you must select three zones so that each zone hosts one unit. 

1. Select **Apply**, then select **Save**.

### Existing instance injected in a virtual network

To manually configure availability zone support on an existing location of an API Management instance that's injected in a virtual network, follow these steps:

1. Review all [requirements and considerations for enabling zone redundancy in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).

1. Create a public IP address in the location to enable availability zones. For detailed requirements, see the [virtual networking guidance](../api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet.md?tabs=stv2#prerequisites).

1. In the Azure portal, go to your API Management instance.

1. On the **Deployment + infrastructure** menu, select **Locations**.

1. Select the location that you want to enable. The location must support availability zones, as mentioned earlier in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Under **Units**, select the number of scale [units](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md) that you want in the location.

1. Under **Availability zones**, leave the **Automatic** setting (recommended), or optionally select one or more zones. If you select specific zones, the number of units that you select must distribute evenly across the availability zones. For example, if you select three units, you must select three zones so that each zone hosts one unit.

1. Under **Public IP Address**, select a public IP address in the location.

1. Select **Apply**, then select **Save**.

### New gateway location

To add a new location to your API Management instance and to configure availability zones in that location, follow these steps:

1. Thoroughly understand all [requirements and considerations for enabling availability zones in API Management](../reliability/reliability-api-management.md).

1. If your API Management instance is deployed in a virtual network in the primary location, set up a [virtual network](../api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet.md), subnet, and optional public IP address in the new location where you plan to enable availability zones.

1. In the Azure portal, go to your API Management instance.

1. On the **Deployment + infrastructure** menu, select **Locations**.

1. Select **+ Add** to add a new location. The location must support availability zones, as mentioned earlier in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Under **Units**, select the number of scale [units](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md) that you want in the location.

1. Under **Availability zones**, leave the **Automatic** setting (recommended), or optionally select one or more zones. If you select specific zones, the number of units that you select must distribute evenly across the availability zones. For example, if you select three units, you must select three zones so that each zone hosts one unit.

1. If your API Management instance is deployed in a virtual network, under **Network**, select the virtual network, subnet, and public IP address that are available in the location.

1. Select **Add**, and then select **Save**.

#### [Premium v2](#tab/premv2)

You can enable zone redundancy when you create a new API Management instance in the **Premium v2** tier. 

* In the Azure portal, use the **Create API Management service** wizard. On the **Basics** tab, under **Zone redundancy**, select **Enable zone redundancy**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-availability-zone-support/enable-zone-redundancy-premium-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enabling zone redundancy for a Premium v2 instance in the portal.":::

* After you create the instance, the status of availability zone support appears on the **Overview** page of the instance in the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> API Management makes a best effort to enable zone redundancy in the selected region. If zone redundancy can't be enabled, the deployment fails, and an error message is displayed.
