> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your API Management instance is in one of the [v2 tiers](../articles/api-management/v2-service-tiers-overview.md), you can only configure details of CA certificates in the authorization credentials of a [backend](../articles/api-management/backends.md). See the guidance for backends for more information.
