> [!NOTE]
> The `Microsoft.Web` resource provider must be registered in the subscription so that you can delegate the subnet to the service. For steps to register a resource provider using the portal, see [Register resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider-1).

For more information about configuring subnet delegation, see [Add or remove a subnet delegation](/azure/virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation).
