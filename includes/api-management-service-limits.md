<!-- Limits - API Management classic tiers -->

Starting March 2026, Azure API Management will apply updated limits to instances in the Classic tiers (Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium) and the Consumption tier. Updated limits will be published at that time. Existing Classic tier services that exceed updated limits won't be impacted. For more information, see [Understanding API Management service limits](../articles/api-management/service-limits.md).
