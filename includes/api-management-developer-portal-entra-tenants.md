> Depending on your requirements for access to the developer portal, you can configure multiple Microsoft Entra ID tenants, including one or more workforce tenants (optionally integrated with Microsoft Entra External ID) and one or more external tenants. Currently, all access is managed through a single app registration and identity provider configuration for the developer portal.
