Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub with Azure Device Registry and Certificate Management integration.

The setup process in this article includes the following steps:

1. Create an IoT hub with a linked namespace.
1. Create an ADR namespace.
1. Create a DPS instance linked to the ADR namespace and IoT hub.
1. Create a credential and policy and associate them to the namespace.
1. Sync your credential and policies to ADR namespace.
1. Create an enrollment group and link to your policy to enable device onboarding.
1. Assign an ADR role, setup the right privileges, and create a user-assigned managed identity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the preview period, ADR and Certificate Management features in IoT Hub are **free of charge**. Device Provisioning Service (DPS) is billed separately and isn't included in the preview offer. For details on DPS pricing, see [Azure IoT Hub pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/).

## Prerequisites

Have an Azure account. If you don't have an Azure account, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Create an IoT hub and ADR namespace in Azure portal

In this section, you create a new IoT hub instance with a new ADR namespace and user-assigned managed identity assigned to it.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure IoT Hub**.
1. In the **IoT Hub** page, select **+ Create** to create a new IoT hub.
1. On the **Basics** tab, complete the fields as follows:

   [!INCLUDE [iot-hub-pii-note-naming-hub](iot-hub-pii-note-naming-hub.md)]

   | Property | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | **Subscription** | Select the subscription to use for your hub. |
   | **Resource group** | Select a resource group or create a new one. To create a new one, select **Create new** and fill in the name you want to use.|
   | **IoT hub name** | Enter a name for your hub. This name must be globally unique, with a length between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters. The name can also include the dash (`'-'`) character.|
   | **Region** | ADR and Certificate Management functionalities are in **preview** and only available in **certain regions**. See the [supported regions](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-what-is-new.md#supported-regions) and select the region, closest to you, where you want your hub to be located.|
   | **Tier** | Select the **Preview** tier. To compare the features available to each tier, select **Compare tiers**.|

### Create a new ADR namespace with system-assigned managed identity

Creating namespace with system-assigned managed identity also creates a credential, known as root CA, and a default policy, known as intermediate CA. [Certificate Management](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-certificate-management-overview.md) uses these credentials and policies to onboard devices to the namespace.

When you select **Create new** in the **ADR namespace** field, a new pane appears to create your ADR namespace.

1. In the Basics tab of Add a new namespace page, fill in the fields as follows:

    | Property | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Subscription** | Select the subscription to use for your ADR namespace. |
    | **Resource group** | Select the resource group you used for your IoT hub. |
    |**Name**| Enter a name for your ADR namespace. Your namespace name can only contain lowercase letters and hyphens ('-') in the middle of the name, but not at the beginning or end. For example, the name "msft-namespace" is valid. |

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/iot-hub-namespace-1.png" alt-text="Screen capture that shows how to fill the basics tab for an ADR namespace in the Azure portal.":::

1. Select the **Next: Identity >** button to continue creating your ADR namespace.
1. In the **Identity** tab, you can choose to enable a system-assigned managed identity and a credential resource for your namespace. To enable these features, toggle the switch to **Enabled**. For more information about how ADR works with managed identities and credential resources, see [What is Certificate Management](../articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-certificate-management-overview.md).

    - Managed identities allow your namespace to authenticate to Azure services without storing credentials in your code. 
    - Credential resources securely store and manage device authentication credentials, such as API keys or certificates, for devices connecting to your namespace. When you enable this feature, you can set policies to control how certificates are issued and managed for your devices.

    | **Name** | Enter a unique name for your policy. The name must be between 3 and 50 alphanumeric characters and can include hyphens (`'-'`). |
    | **Validity period (days)** | Enter the number of days the issued certificates are valid. The validity period must be between 1 and 3650 days (10 years). |

1. Select **Review + create** to review your settings.
1. The new policy appears in the list of policies for your namespace. You can select the policy to view its details.
1. In the policy overview page, you can see the policy name, validity period, and status, which should be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> Editing or disabling a policy isn't supported in public preview.

At this point, you created a new hub, a new Device Provisioning Service (DPS) instance, and linked your Azure Device Registry (ADR) namespace to your hub and DPS instance. You can now proceed to create enrollments and assign the policy to manage device onboarding. Follow the steps in the next section to complete the setup.

## Create an enrollment group and assign a policy

To provision devices with leaf certificates, you need to create an enrollment group and assign the policy created within your ADR namespace. The allocation-policy defines the onboarding authentication mechanism DPS uses before issuing a leaf certificate. The default attestation mechanism is a symmetric key.

1. In the **Settings** menu of your DPS instance, select **Manage enrollment**.
1. In the **Manage enrollments** page, select either the **Enrollment groups** or **Individual enrollments** tab based on your provisioning needs.
1. Select **+ Add enrollment group** or **+ Add individual enrollment** to create a new enrollment.
1. In the **Registration + provisioning** page, complete the fields as follows:
    
    | Property | Value |    
    | -------- | ----- |
    | **Attestation mechanism** | Select **X.509 intermediate certificate** as the attestation method. |
    | **X.509 certificate settings** | Upload the intermediate certificate files. Enrollments have one or two certificates, known as primary and secondary certificate files. |
    | **Group name** | Enter a name for your enrollment group. Skip this field if you're creating an individual enrollment. |
    | **Provisioning status** | Select **Enabled** to enable the enrollment from provisioning. |
    | **Reprovision policy** | Specify the reprovisioning policy for the enrollment. This policy determines how the enrollment behaves during device reprovisioning. |

1. Go to the **Credential policies (Preview)** tab.
1. Select the **policy** you want to assign to the enrollment group or individual enrollment.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/add-enrollment-group-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Device Registry assigning a policy to an enrollment group in the Azure portal." lightbox="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/add-enrollment-group-policy.png":::

1. Complete the remaining fields in the enrollment creation process and select **Create** to finalize the enrollment.

## Sync policies to IoT hubs

Synchronize a policy created within your ADR namespace to the IoT hub linked to that namespace. This synchronization enables IoT Hub to trust any devices authenticating with a leaf certificate issued by the policy's issuing CA (ICA).

1. Go to the **Namespaces** page.
1. Select the namespace you want to sync policies for.
1. In the namespace page, under **Namespace resources**, select **Credential policies (Preview)**.
1. In the **Credential policies** page, you can view your policies, validity periods, intervals, and status.
1. Select the policies you want to sync. You can sync more than one policy at a time.
1. Select **Sync**.

    :::image type="content" source="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/sync-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the namespace page in Azure portal that shows the sync option." lightbox="../articles/iot-hub/media/device-registry/sync-policies.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you select to sync more than one policy, policies are synced to their respective IoT hubs. You can't undo a sync operation once it's done.

At this point, you created an IoT hub with Azure Device Registry and Certificate Management integration using the Azure portal. You can now manage your IoT devices securely using the policies and enrollments you have set up.
