> [!NOTE]
> The functionality that the following sections describe can also be accessed via [Backup center](../articles/backup/backup-center-overview.md). Backup center is a single unified management experience in Azure. It enables enterprises to govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale. With this solution, you can perform most of the key operations for backup management without being limited to the scope of an individual vault.
